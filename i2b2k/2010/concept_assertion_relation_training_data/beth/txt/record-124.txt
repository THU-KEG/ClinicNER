History of Present Illness :
54 yo F with Crohn 's s/p ileostomy and subsequent short gut syndrome with port-a-cath placement for TPN who presents with progressive right sided chest pain that comes in waves .
The pt reports sharp 10/10 chest pain under the right breast which is getting progressively worse .
The pain is worsened with deep inspiration or movement .
It initially started one day previously but has gotten significantly worse over last 12 hours .
It is associated with SOB as well as fevers , chills .
The pt denies abd pain , n/v or increased ostomy output .
Given her fever , sx of chest pain and SOB as well as an elevated WBC count , she was initially thought to have a PNA .
She was therefore given ceftriaxone 1 g IV x1 and azithromycin 500 mg PO x1 in the Deanna .
As the CXR was without any evidence of PNA , or PTX , the pt subsequently received a CTA to evaluate for PE which revealed multifocal bilateral PNA but no PE .
At this time , she was given Vancomycin 1 g IV x1 .
She was also given morphine 2 mg x3 , 4 mg IV x2 , dolasetron 12.5 mg x2 and ativan 1 mg IV x1 .

Abd CT performed 09-01 showed multiple calcifications in the body and tail of the pancreas with a larger cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas .
A second 9 mm cystic lesion is seen in the head of the pancreas .

Brief Hospital Course :
54 yo F with Crohn 's disease s/p ileostomy with subsequent short gut syndrome with port-o-cath for TPN presents with acute onset pleuritic chest pain with fever , chills , and sob .
1. Chest pain / Fever / Chills :
The acute onset of chest pain was initially very concerning for a PE , however the Chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidation consistent with a bacterial PNA .
This is consistent with the remainder of the pt 's history including fever , chills , sob and an elevated WBC count .
The pt was given ceftriaxone / azithromycin / vancomycin in Deanna .
Blood , urine and sputum culutres were sent .
Pt 's blood cultures came back positive for Staph Aureus and Enterococcus , both were pansensitive .
Sputum culture also returned with Staph. Aureus .
Ceftriaxone and azithro were discontinued , and Vacomycin was continued .
Pt initially was hypoxic requiring NRB for O2 sat of 94% , with any attempt to wean she would desat .
Pt was intubated prior to tunneled catheter removal , see below .
( The tunneled catheter later came back for negative for culture. )
Earlier that day pt had a chest x ray which showed diffuse infiltrative process concerning for ARDS .
Post procedure pt remained intubated on ARDSnet protocol .
She self extubated the first day and was reintubated without any complications .
Her O2 requirement improved on the vent over the next few days and she was weaned off the vent on 2013-01-01 .
After extubation her o2 requirement was down to 1L NC with sats in mid 90s .
She was transferred to the floor for further managment .
The patient remained afebrile when she transferred to the medicine service .
She was weaned off the oxygen and for the remainder of her course her O2sats were stable on room air .
The patient had completed her antibiotic course while in house .
2. Hx of multiple port-o-cath clots :
Although the pt is on warfarin chronically , her INR was subtherapeutic .
Goal INR 01-31 .
Initially coumadin was increased , however given concern for infected line , general surgery was consulted who removed the line in the ICU .
3. ARF :
Pt initially with mild ARI , this was thought to be due to dehydration , after initial volume repletion her renal function improved to her baseline .
4. CMED :
The pt has a history of paranoia / depression .
ON admission she was taking Quetiapine 300 mg QHS and Clonazepam 1 mg QAM , 1 mg Q3PM , 2 mg PO QHS .
Quetiapine was continued however clonipin was initially held when she was intubated on fentynyl / versed .
This was restarted post extubation .
Intially after being transferred from the ICU to the medicine service the patient was mentating appropriately .
Her course later became complicated by visual and auditory hallucinations .
She made disturbing comments to the hospital personnel .
She was unable to sleep at night , often pacing the halls .
She required a 1:1 sitter .
Psychiatry was consulted .
They felt that her presentation was secondary to delirium and was multifactorial .
They attributed it to polypharmacy , recent infection ( pneumonia ) and insomnia .
A head CT was done which ruled out any acute processes .
The patient refused an LP .
They made recommendations for adjustments to her anti-psychotic medications .
At discharge the patient was on clonazepam 1 mg tid , seroquel 300 BID and neurontin 600 QAM , 1200 QPM and 1200 QHS .
The Kindred Hospital hospital course was prolonged because of her delirium .
Once her mental status improved she was discharged .
5. ? Parkinson 's Disease / Akithesia :
The patient was maintained Sinemet .
6. Pain :
In addition to her usual neuropathy pain , the pt initially appeared to have significant pain from the multi-focal PNA as well .
( Home regimen , Gabapentin 800 mg PO QAM , 1600 mg PO Q3PM , 1600 mg PO QHS .
This was held in the ICU and she was given diluadid prn for pain control .
The patient 's narcotic and CMED CCU regimen was evaluated by psychiatry during her delirium .
Please see above for their recommendations .
7. FEN :
Given her hx of ileostomy secondary to crohn 's disease and resultant short gut syndrome , the pt requires nutritional support via TPN .
After removal of tunneled line pt was given tube feeds while she was intubated .
The patient was transitioned to a low fat , low residue diet .
