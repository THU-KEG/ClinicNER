BRIEF HISTORY :
She is a 57-year-old chronic dialysis patient who was admitted with an occluded right forearm dialysis AV graft and hyperkalemia .
The patient underwent dialysis AV graft thrombectomy and this was complicated by poor result due to stenosis and fibrosed nature of graft .
She subsequently had swelling of her left arm and ongoing hyperkalemia which was managed with Kayexalate .
She was admitted to reestablish dialysis angio access and to optimize dialysis indices .
PREVIOUS HISTORY :
1. Endstage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease status post failed transplant on chronic hemodialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center .
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
3. Restless leg syndrome .
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm .
5. Hyperlipidemia .
6. History of coronary artery disease status post MI .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
1. Atenolol .
2. Aspirin .
3. Quinine .
4. Mirapex .
5. Renagel .
6. Nephrocaps .
7. Protonix .
8. Lipitor .
9. Albuterol .
10. Atrovent .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is married .
She is a chronic smoker .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
As detailed in fellow and nurse practitioner notes .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Afebrile .
Vital signs stable .
Blood pressure 90/40 to 110/60 .
Alert and orientated .
Pleasant .
Chest :
Clear anteriorly and at bases .
Normal cardiac sounds .
Ejection systolic murmur .
Abdomen :
Benign .
Right forearm :
AV graft with extensive hematoma and ecchymosis and difficulty to access .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Potassium 6.3 down to 4.8 , calcium 8.3 , phosphorus 5 .
BUN 35 , creatinine 5.9 , hematocrit 34.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Dialysis :
She received dialysis via a remnant of her AV graft but clearance was suboptimal and graft will not be usable over the long-term .
She was therefore referred for a dialysis tunneled angiocatheter and will be seen by the surgical service as an outpatient for elective revision of her AV graft surgically .
Her potassium was stable postdialysis in the 4 range .
Her hematocrit was however low and with followup pending .
The patient has chronic outpatient dialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and communication regarding her angio access status will be performed .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease .
She had labile blood pressure following dialysis likely related to fluid removal and then sedating medications for catheter placement .
She resolved spontaneously with small fluid bolus and with no further difficulties .
3. Metabolic :
Hyperkalemia as noted .
Now stable with reestablishment of vascular access .
Anemia :
Probably a component of CKD , dilutional and blood loss with procedures .
Pending reevaluation will be monitored in an outpatient setting .
Increase dose of EPO .
No need for transfusion at this stage given the patient is asymptomatic and no episodes of GI bleeding documented .
The patient will follow up with her primary nephrologist at the Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and with Dr. N Tland at DH .
She will have scheduled appointment made through the vascular access program for access revision .
