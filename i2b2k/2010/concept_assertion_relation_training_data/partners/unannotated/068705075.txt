HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Shalyo Kaysplass is a 36-year-old male , with metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , admitted with shortness of breath , hemoptysis , and hip pain .
Mr. Kaysplass &apos;s history is well-documented in previous discharge summaries .
Basically , he was diagnosed in 1994 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone in his left hip , underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy , but was not a candidate for surgical resection and so underwent radiation therapy to the left hip .
He had metastases to the lungs , which responded to more chemotherapy and he underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in January , 1996 .
For the past six weeks prior to admission , the patient was complaining of worsening right hip pain at the site of a bone marrow biopsy done to evaluate a new pancytopenia .
An magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a mass growing out of the right sacrum , which could have been tumor or a hematoma .
Approximately a week before admission , repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enlarging soft tissue mass consistent with tumor .
Chest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules , which were thought , given the clinical situation , to be tumor .
The patient was set to undergo radiation therapy to the mass in the right hip when he called complaining of fatigue , dyspnea on exertion , and persistent hip pain .
He also complained of fever .

His hemoptysis did not improve and his platelet count was quite low .
Due to intermittent bouts of shortness of breath , and the understanding that he had a widely-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , he was made a do not resuscitate , and on the fifth hospital day , the patient expired .
