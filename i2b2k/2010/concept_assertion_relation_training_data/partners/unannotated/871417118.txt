There was a small incisional hernia in his upper scar .
His perineum exam was unremarkable .
Colonoscopy done elsewhere in 03/94 was normal .
CEA was 3.8 before radiation , and 3.0 after radiation .
CBT scan done on 8/25/94 showed a 3 cm. rounded , presacral mass with left-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter extending down to the mass .
