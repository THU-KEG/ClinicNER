The patient was admitted to the Mountglensfallslo Medical Center on the day of admission for a left eye vitrectomy secondary to &quot; retained lens material . &quot;
She was intubated , received general anesthesia , and 350 cc of fluid .
The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken to the post anesthesia care unit -- the surgery without complications .
She was noted to have rapid shallow breathing with oxygen saturations of 87% , a heart rate of 95 to 100 , blood pressure of 208 to 90 .
The patient was given albuterol nebs , 10 of intravenous Lasix , 15 mg of esmolol , 2 mg of intravenous morphine and was put on 100% nonrebreather with improvement of her oxygen saturations to 98% and her blood pressure decreased to 164/70 .
A chest x-ray was consistent with interstitial edema .
An arterial blood gas was done when the patient was at her nadir which came back as oxygen saturations of 67 , CO2 of 57 , pH of 7.28 and that is when oxygen saturations were 87% .
The patient urinated greater than 400 cc to Lasix .

An exercise tolerance test in 04/95 was without ischemia .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY / PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , type II x 25 years , hypertension , a positive PPD with a negative chest x-ray in 04/96 , treated with INH x five months , status post varicose vein surgery , status post prior eye surgery , status post tubal ligation .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH 40 units subcutaneous qam , Vasotec 10 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 30 mg PO qhs , Paxil 20 mg PO qhs , INH x five months , B-6 .

She lives in Woodgrand Newkee and has an involved daughter .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission demonstrated patient seeming in no acute distress .
Her temperature was 98.1 , pulse 70 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations 20 , oxygen saturations 100% on 60% face mask .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination demonstrated oropharynx clear , patch over left eye , pupil was round and reflexive to light on the right , right extraocular movements were intact , jugular venous distention was about 7 centimeters .
There was no lymphadenopathy , carotids were 2+ without bruits bilaterally .
Lungs :
there were crackles bilaterally approximately one half of the way up , no wheezes or rhonchi .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops or rubs , point of maximum impulse was within normal limits .
The abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended , obese , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities :
no edema on the right , trace edema on the left .
No clubbing , cyanosis , feet without signs of infection .
The rectal examination demonstrated guaiac negative brown stool with good rectal tone .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient had admission sodium 137 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 30.6 , BUN and creatinine 20 and 1.4 , glucose 261 , calcium 8.6 , phosphate 3.6 , magnesium 1.1 , total protein 7.3 , albumin 3.2 , globulin 4.1 , direct bilirubin 0 , total bilirubin 0.5 , serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 65 , lactic acid dehydrogenase 292 , creatine kinase 186 with isos less than 0.4 , white blood count 8.8 , hematocrit 32.0 , platelet count 167,000 , mean corpuscular volume 87 .
The chest x-ray was as per history of present illness .
The electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute , questionable minor ST depression in V4 through V6 , T wave flattening in AVL .
Compared with a Ca Valley Hospital 7-17-96 electrocardiogram , V3 T waves are now upright , inverted T wave in 07/96 .
Also , T waves peaked in today &apos;s electrocardiogram consistent with hyperkalemia , otherwise without change .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure indicated by her chest x-ray , lung examination and history .
She responded well to Lasix and on 1-25 had clear lungs on examination and normal oxygen saturations on room air .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 72% , trace mitral regurgitation , a left ventricle with no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities .
There was also trace tricuspid insufficiency .
The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .
There was an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no shunt flow was detected by color Doppler .
The patient &apos;s episode of failure was thought to be most likely be due to diastolic dysfunction precipitated by tachycardia and hypertension .
The patient successfully ruled out for myocardial infarction with a peak creatine kinase being 199 .
Her Procardia was discontinued and her Vasotec was increased to 15 mg PO q.day .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition .
