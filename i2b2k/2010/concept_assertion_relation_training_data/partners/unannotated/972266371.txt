CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Fever , abdominal pain and vomiting .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Riie Pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and &quot; left kidney pain &quot; .
This patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .
In the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .
In early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .
In 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .
In early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .
CT imaging at that time was negative for disease .
In April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .
Thereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .
Most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .
That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .
He was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .
It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .
Finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .
Mr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .
As well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to &quot; kidney pain &quot; .
He was given Flagyl and had already apparently been on Levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia .
Mr. Pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing .
He denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as mentioned , new skin changes or diarrhea .
There is no joint swelling or tenderness .
He otherwise feels about the same as when he left the hospital recently except for his left abdominal flank pain .
