Glucose 141 , white blood count 5.8 , hct 33.3 , platelet count 216,000 , cholesterol 170 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the cardiac access unit and had cardiac catheterization performed on 9/24/93 .
This showed some severe left main and LAD disease as well as moderate RCA lesion .
The patient was stable and was evaluated by Neurology for a question of a TIA in the past .
It was felt that this was medication related rather than actual neurologic event .
The patient was evaluated by cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft .
She had vascular studies performed on 9/24/93 which showed normal carotid arteries .
On 9/24/93 she also had an evaluation by pulmonary for her previous history of bronchiectasis .
She remained stable .
The patient was evaluated by Vascular Surgery for repair of false femoral aneurysm and it was determined that it would be done simultaneously with coronary artery bypass grafting .
This was done on 9/29/93 .
Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Care was taken to maintain her postoperative blood pressure secondary to a cannulation site being somewhat friable and a patch being placed intraoperatively .
On postop day # 1 the patient was extubated and was on 60% face mask with 99% saturation .
She continued on Vancomycin and Gentamicin for enterococcal / proteus UTI .
It was found that her UA showed decreasing white blood cells .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 10/1/93 .
She continued with pulmonary toilet and had sputum cultures checked .
She had a temperature to 101.1 , on 10/2/93 .
She was cultured and there was no localization of fever source .

She was changed to p.o. Ampicillin for her urinary tract infection coverage and remained afebrile on that coverage .
She had new onset a. fib on 10/6/93 , and was converted to sinus rhythm with Digoxin loading .
She remained afebrile and was able to be transferred to rehabilitation on 10/7/93 or 10/8/93 , without difficulties .
