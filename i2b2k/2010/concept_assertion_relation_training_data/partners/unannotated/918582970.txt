The estimated blood loss was 200 cc and one gram of Ancef was given intraoperatively .
There was 235 cc of urine output with clear urine at the end of the procedure and one Jackson-Pratt drain was placed to bulb suction in the left inguinal region .
Postoperatively the patient did well .
Her pain was well controlled with a PCA .
She had positive flatus on 1/6/00 and her diet was advanced as tolerated to a full diet without difficulty .
Her Foley catheter was discontinued on 1/8/00 and she was able to urinate with some mild dysuria .
A urinalysis was sent and she was noted to have approximately 20 white blood cells and too numerous to count red blood cells .
With the presumptive diagnosis of early urinary tract infection , the patient was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. on 1/9/00 .
On 1/8/00 she also passed two large bowel movements for normal bowel function .
As the Jackson-Pratt drained only 15 cc on 1/8/00 , it was removed on 1/9/00 without complications .
As the patient was doing well and was afebrile and urinating , passing stool , and ambulating without difficulty , she was discharged to Limount Chael&apos;se Medical Center .
