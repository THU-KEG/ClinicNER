Recurrent right neck mass in April , 1998 , four resection of right neck mass by Dr. Cuchsoissfreiermcot , and for preoperative intentional balloon sacrifice of right internal carotid artery and common carotid artery due to evidence of invasion at the time of initial attempted surgical exploration .

LABORATORY DATA AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
During hospitalization computerized tomography scan examination of brain performed with and without intravenous contrast enhancement was obtained , following demonstration of left partial homonymous hemianopsia .
Computerized tomography scan demonstrated two murally enhancing cystic masses , the first occupying much of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere , the second shown focally in the left lateral occipital lobe , with associated vasogenic edema .
Metastatic disease suspected .
Additional magnetic resonance angiogram examination requested .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted on 1/10/99 , at which time intentional balloon sacrifice of right coronary artery was performed .
Systemic anticoagulation was accomplished with limited mobility permitted .
Over the course of the next three days the patient was mobilized .
At this time the diagnosis of presumed metastatic involvement of a super-tentorial and infratentorial compartments had been arrived at , and it was also noted that the patient &apos;s swallowing was sufficiently impaired where Nutrition was compromised and in question .
It was decided at this point that the patient &apos;s neck resection may need to be withheld pending exploration of chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy options , and that the Nutrition status would need to be addressed .
As such , it was decided that a transfer to the Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital under Dr. Cuchsoissfreiermcot &apos;care , who is the patient &apos;s Oncologic Otolaryngologic Surgeon , should be entertained .
On the evening of 1/14/99 , nursing noticed that the patient was somewhat confused , and suspected a possible post ictal state .
As such , the patient was placed on Dilantin , and Dilantin is being continued .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good , with the exception of brain metastases and difficulty swallowing .
