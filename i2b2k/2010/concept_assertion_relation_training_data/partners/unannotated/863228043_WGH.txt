HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Walking underwent thoracentesis by interventional radiology .
They removed 600 cc of yellow fluid .
Fluid characteristics were exudative .
Cytology and microbiology including AFP cultures are pending at this time .
After the thoracentesis , Ms. Walking &apos;s ambulatory room air saturation was 94% and she was feeling better .
Ms. Walking also underwent echocardiogram .
Her LV ejection fraction was 77% .
The estimated RV systolic pressure was 47 .
Because of a concern of a solid mass on the lesser curvature of her stomach noted by abdominal CAT scan , Ms. Walking had a GI consultation .
The gastroenterologist performed an EGD and EUS .
The EGD showed a normal esophagus , a submucosal mass in the cardia and fundus of the stomach with central umbilication , nodularity in the prepyloric antrum , and a normal duodenum .
The EUS showed a normal common bile duct , normal pancreas and a 4-cm gastric wall solid mass , which was hypoechoic , heterogenetic and lobulated in appearance .
She had biopsies taken , which are pending at this time .
Of note , there was an extensive differential diagnosis for her unilateral effusion including malignancy , tuberculosis , drug-induced lupus and less likely pestis related .
The exudative nature of the effusion argues against congestive heart failure or hepatic hydrothorax .
Ms. Walking was stable at the time of discharge .
She was discharged home .
