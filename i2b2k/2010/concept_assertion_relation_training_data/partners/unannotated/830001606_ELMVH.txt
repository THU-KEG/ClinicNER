He underwent CT which showed distal partial small bowel obstruction and was admitted .
--- Hospital course :
1. GI :
He was placed NPO .
Multiple attempts of NGT placement were made but the patient continued to refuse .
Finally he tolerated it at 8pm and it was placed for three hours .
His abd had further distended with more tenderness at the point he allowed placement of NGT .
Then three hours later , he pulled it out and refused further placements .
He received IVF .
Surgery was consulted and they recommended q4hour abd exams which were performed .
The following day his signs and symptoms became much better .
He was moving much flatus and was very hungry .
His tendernes was markedly diminished and his abd was less distended .
His diet was advanced as tolerated .
He did eat a half of a turkey sandwich against medical advice but did fine with it .
--- CV :
His BP was elevated throughout admission and he was started on Atenolol upon discharge .
Also , he was started on Lipitor and Asa on discharge as he has a hx of MI .
He was noted to have a larger L LE than R and LENIS revealed Popliteal DVT .
This was thought to be chronic and so anticoagulation was not initiated .
It is recommended that he get repeat ultrasound within two weeks to eval for extension to reassure that it is chronic .
--- DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Follow up with PCP within two weeks .
