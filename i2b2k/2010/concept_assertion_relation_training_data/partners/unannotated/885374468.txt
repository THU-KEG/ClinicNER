HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Po is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. Po presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the May of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By October of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He has seen two local physicians , who have tried him first on Bactrim and subsequently Clarithromycin without improvement .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Remarkable for a history of ulcers .
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic .
Skin is pale .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
There is no thyroid , cervical , or supraclavicular adenopathy .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
There is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
PT was 19.8 seconds .
His three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a PO2 of 63 , PCO2 of 47 , pH of 7.39 .
A chest X-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. Jesclinke on 4/22/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on Mar 30 , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tagamet , 800 mg. PO q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; Carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; Ativan , 1 mg. SL q.4 p.r.n.
