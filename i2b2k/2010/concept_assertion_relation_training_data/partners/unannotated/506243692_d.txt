DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :
NERTLAND , ELRO
UNIT NUMBER :
413-18-46
ADMISSION DATE :
02/02/2002
DISCHARGE DATE :
02/14/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Dilated cardiomyopathy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Interstitial lung disease , mitral regurgitation , systolic hypertension , status post myocardial infarction , transurethral resection of prostate , inguinal hernia repair , shingles , cataracts , ulcer disease , gout , mediastinal mass , thymoma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right heart catheterization .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Nertland is an 84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure .
The patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis .
He was recently hospitalized at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization .
After a comprehensive assessment , Drs. Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .
He was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .
Unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for above .
For long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .
The patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .
Initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 14 .
Jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .
The carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .
The point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .
There was no S3 gallop .
Abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .
A chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .
The PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .
Initially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .
The patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .
Because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .
On Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient &apos;s right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .
Systemic vascular resistance was 900 .
The patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .
Over the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .
At discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .
Should he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .
The patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Lasix 20 mg. q.day .
Isordil 10 mg. t.i.d. Aldactone 25 mg. q.d. Digoxin .125 mg. q.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 100 mg. q.d.
Serevent and Flovent inhalers the patient b.i.d. Zoloft 25 mg. q.d. Nexium 40 mg. b.i.d. Captopril 25 mg. t.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Seroquel 25 mg. q.d.
The patient will be maintained with a goal weight of 120 pounds .
Should his weight fall below 118 pounds , then he has been instructed to hold his Lasix .
Should his weight increase above 122 pounds , then the patient will take 40 mg. of Lasix a day .
FOLLOW UP :
He will be followed closely by Dr. Sieh and Mizy Flomhemp of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program .
In addition he will seen as necessary by Dr. Ri Tlandmaul of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Psychiatry Service .
