Discharge Date :

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73-year-old white man status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 admitted for catheterization for evaluation of the current anginal symptoms and a positive exercise tolerance test .
The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 because of unstable angina with LIMA to the LAD and SVG to the OMB and PDA .
The patient was free of angina until six weeks prior to admission when he began to have anginal symptoms described as a heaviness beginning in the scapula , moving to the retrosternal chest and radiating to the left shoulder with no other associated symptoms .
These anginal episodes occurred after exercise and also at rest resolving in two to five minutes .
An exercise tolerance test on 9/21/92 was stopped at seven minutes because of fatigue and chest pain .
There were positive EKG changes in the inferolateral leads and thallium showed a reversible ischemia in the inferoapical region .
Addition of diltiazem to the patient &apos;s aspirin and Dyazide medical treatment had no improvement in symptoms .
The patient had no symptoms of congestive heart failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia .
The patient started Leukorin treatment two days prior to admission for a white count of 100,000 .
Hypertension .
Hyperlipidemia .
Left total hip replacement in 1988 .
Low back pain .
Right internal carotid artery stenosis of 80-90% diagnosed by carotid noninvasives after an episode of amaurosis fugax .
Gout .
Skin cancer .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day ; Levoxine , 0.1 mg q day ; Leukorin , 2 mg two po q a.m.
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative except for increasing fatigue in the past two weeks and leg cramps at night .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a blood pressure of 158/88 .
Pulse 70 .
Temperature 97.4 .
Respiratory rate 18 .
Physical examination was significant for ulcerated fungating lesions on his left ear , dorsum of his hands .
There was a right carotid bruit .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , S4 without murmurs .
Spleen was felt 4 cm below the costal margin .
The liver was 10 cm by percussion .
There were palpable inguinal lymph nodes .
Pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a white blood cell count of 77.8 with 82% lymphs .
Hematocrit 35.2 .
Platelet count 104,000 .
BUN / creatinine 26/1.4 .
Potassium 4.4 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , normal axis and intervals , no changes from previous EKG , no signs of ischemia or infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on 11/2/92 which showed the following :
Pressures RA 9/4 , RV 24/7 , PA 24/12 with a mean of 14 , PCW 12/9 with a mean of 10 .
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
SVR 943 .
Angiography showed an occluded SVG graft to OM1 , patent SVG graft to the RCA , patent LIMA to the LAD .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient received 600 cc of contrast and the PTCA procedure took approximately three hours .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on 11/4/92 and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 25 on 11/4/92 .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on 11/5 .
It was thought that the drop in hematocrit was secondary to his chemotherapy , some small dilutional effect and small blood loss from the PTCA , although there was no evidence of significant bleeding .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .
He is to be discharged home on 11/6 with follow-up with Dr. Kote , his cardiologist and with Dr. Right , his hematologist .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included Levoxine , 0.1 mg po q day ; diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Leukeran , 2 mg po two q a.m. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day .
