Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
05-01-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
05-22-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric outlet obstruction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Obstructive jaundice .
2. metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver .
3. biliary obstruction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , 05/05/94 .
Gastrojejunostomy , 05/08/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 111y year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on 05/01 complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of 12/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On 01/24 she was taken to the Rys Memorial Hospital hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center and admitted there from 01/25 - 02/03 .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .

LABORATORY DATA :
White count 13.8 , hematocrit 33 , platelet count 353,000 .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
Sed rate 100 .
PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On 05/05 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
