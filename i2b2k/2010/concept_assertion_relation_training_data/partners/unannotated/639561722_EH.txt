A / P. 51F chronic tobacco , crack , schizoaffective and likely OSA p / w DOE / SOB .
1.) CV .
(I). Trop 0.15 , and TWI anterolateral , but likely has some demand w biventricular enlargement w chronic HTN and possible pulm HTN .
Also may have vasospasm w crack use .
Got lovenox 80 in ED , but likely doesn &apos;t need anti-platelet meds as yet .
-- Trop still 0.17 on 3rd draw , likely will take a long time to come down , still no indication for anti-platelet agents
-- ASA 81 , no B blocker because of recent crack use , fasting lipids 2/21/06 actually looked very good with LDL 91 .
ECHO 2/22 shows enlarged LV with EF roughly 25% , biatrial enlargement and moderate mitral regurgitation .
Started bumex ( patient preferred this to lasix because her father had lasix in the past and did poorly ) and lisinopril as an outpatient .
She was assigned to a new cardiologist Dr. Pulefreierm whom she will see one week after discharge .
-- BP control with captopril , converted to lisinopril for discharge . (R) .
NSR , no active issues .
2.) PULM .
CXR slightly improved , afebrile , normal WBC , but had terrible exam on admission .
No antibiotics were given and sputum culture grew oral flora .
She likely has bad lungs with her chronic crack use .
-- ATC duonebs , ATC guiafenisen , PRN albuterol and chest PT given throughout admission .
She was discharged on Advair and albuterol inhalers with instructions to follow-up with PCP for PFTs
-- A CT PA of the chest on 2/21 showed no PE , but did show a small loculated R pleural effusion in the area of her prior pneumonia .
Talked with pulmonary service briefly who recommended possible CT-guided thoracentesis to investigate for possible underlying malignancy .
The patient refused to have this done as an inpatient , but will consider having it done as an outpatient after discharge .
She will at the least have follow-up imaging with her new PCP Dr. Still at the next visit .
3.) CRI .
Cr stable at baseline .
4.) PSYCH / PSA / SOCIAL .
On Q month haldol for schizoaffective as outpatient .
She did not require any PRN Haldol throughout admission .

PPX :

DISPO :
The patient does have underlying psychiatric disease , but did meet criteria for capacity for all medical decisions during her hospitalization .
Given her history of non-compliance and drug abuse , however , the team spoke with 2 family members and her psychiatrist at Lumnerow Health prior to discharge to review the diagnoses and the discharge plan , emphasizing the importance of making her follow-up appointments with Dr. Endo , Dr. Pulefreierm and Br. Still .
Her family members were given phone numbers for all of her physicians to call if there are concerns that she is endangering herself with non-compliance in the future , at which time there may be further discussions regarding capacit / competency , and possible guardianship .
FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
DO NOT USE CRACK AGAIN .
Your difficulty breathing is partly caused by your smoking and your crack use , your symptoms will get better if you stop using tobacco and crack .
If you do decide to quit you can call 632.264.7348 for help with quitting smoking , and they can direct you to help for quitting crack .
It is also very important that you keep your next appointments with your new doctors , and take all of your medications , including the inhalers , as prescribed .
The Bumex will help keep extra fluid off your heart and help you breath better .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Satisfactory
