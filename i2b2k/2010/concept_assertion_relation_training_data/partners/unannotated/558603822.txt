She had recently completed a cycle of gemcitabine and Taxotere .
Her primary oncologist felt that she was end-stage , but the patient and her family were questioning for additional treatment .
She was seen at Carmoaksfearwhit Hospital for regular follow up to check her cell counts .
She was found at that time to have possible cellulitis and was admitted for this as well as out of concern that she had had many falls at home and did not have services .
The patient reported noticing redness on her left hand incidentally the morning of admission and denied any fevers or cuts .
The hand was nontender .
Her most recent fall was the day prior to admission , and she did not hit her head .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
In 1992 , she had left calf leiomyosarcoma resection with radiation .
In 1995 , she had pulmonary metastasis and received chemotherapy and wedge resections .
She also had metastasis of her liver , lungs , and pancreas .
In 1999 , she had central nervous system evolvement with left parietal mass resection .
In 2003 , her left lower lobe lung mass progressed , and she was deemed not to be a surgical candidate .
She also had a history of deep venous thrombosis , reflex sympathetic dystrophy , PCP pneumonia , cesarean section 1999 , and history of uveitis .

A chronically ill-appearing , pale woman with mild dyspnea , speaking in full sentences .
Oropharynx is without petechiae or evidence of bleeding .
She did have mild thrush , no exudate , no lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular Exam :
Regular rate and rhythm , 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left upper sternal base without aeration .
Lung exam revealed diffuse breast sounds over the left lower lobe as well as left upper lobe .

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for possible cellulitis of the right hand .
She was initially given Ancef IV .
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the second day of her admission due to hypercarbic respiratory distress .
Her blood gas at that time was PH 7.26 , bicarb 93 , oxygen 70 , chest x-ray was felt to be consistent with fluid overload .
There was also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion .
She was also covered with levofloxacin empirically for pneumonia .
She was started on nasal BiPAP and repeat arterial blood gas on the BiPAP was PH 7.26 , PCO2 1.11 , and PO2 157 .
Her code status was visited with her family .
They felt the cause of her dyspnea was potentially reversible , and that she would want aggressive management at that time .
1. Respiratory :
The patient was intubated with goal of decreasing her PCO2 .
This was accomplished and her arterial blood gas improved PH 7.49 , PCO2 58 , and PO2 242 .
She had abronchoscopy on 09/18/2004 which revealed a left lower lobe basal segment tumor versus mucous plug versus edematous versus foreign body aspiration .
The patient self-extubated on 09/20/2004 and was maintained on intermittent noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until the time of her death .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient required neosynephrine throughout her intensive care unit stay .
This was continued until 09/24/2004 at which time her family decided to withdraw pressers .
3. Comfort :
The patient was agitated and uncomfortable throughout much of her intensive care unit stay .
It was difficult to both keep her comfortable and maintain adequate respiratory drive .
Her pulmonary status gradually worsened throughout her intensive care stay after her self-extubation on 09/20/2004 .
Reintubation was not desired by the patient or the family .
Her code status was DNR .
She developed rattling in her trachea audible without a stethoscope on 09/24/2004 , was poorly arousable , and had a venous PCO2 of 103 .
She was more awake that afternoon , was able to interact somewhat with her family .
However , in light of her suffering and terminal condition , her family elected to discontinue the use of neosynephrine .
The patient died on 09/25/2004 at 12:49 a.m.
Death was pronounced by Dr. Ilon Cale .
The family was offered and declined a postmortem examination .
Prior to her death , she had been comfortable on the Morphine drip .
