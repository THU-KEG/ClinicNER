OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES :
FEMOROPOPLITEAL BYPASS ON 06-28-90 , BY DR. RISHAN THOREGORB .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is well known to the Chief Service and was recently discharged on 06-13-90 .
Her original admission was for an ischemic left foot .
History reveals a 72 year old woman with multiple medical problems including chronic atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , polyarticular gouty arthritis , who is confined to a wheelchair .
She has peripheral vascular disease and ischemic left foot , for which she was admitted and underwent angiography and angioplasty on her previous admission , which was from 6-6-90 to 06-13-90 .
She had angioplasty of her left external iliac and proximal distal superficial femoral artery .
She returns for a progressively ischemic left foot .
She was admitted to the Service on 06-25-90 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include .0675 of digoxin a day , prednisone 15 milligrams per day , Capoten 6.25 milligrams a day , Pepcid 20milligrams a day , cardizem 90 milligrams each morning .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her examination is remarkable for a Cushingoid-appearing woman in no acute distress with multiple ecchymoses over her body .
She has obvious deformities of her joints from her arthritic condition .
She has brisk upstrokes in the carotids without any bruits .
Lungs are clear .
Heart has normal rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
She has a colostomy on the left side that is healthy .
Extremities are remarkable for deformities secondary to arthritis with a swan deformity of her fingers .
Her pulses are carotids II+ bilaterally , radial pulses II+ bilaterally , right leg has II+ femoral , I+ dorsalis pedis and I+ posterior tibialis .
On the left side , she has no pulses below her femoral pulses .
On her left foot , her first , third and fourth toes are black with gangrene and there is an area of hyperemia just proximal to that .
She also has a ulcer on the left heel .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , laboratory data were unremarkable and within normal limits , except for creatinine 1.6. Hematocrit on admission was 34.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and had preoperative evaluation .
She was taken to the operating room on 06-27-90 , and underwent a left femoral to below-the-knee popliteal in situ graft using the saphenous vein .
The patient underwent the procedure without any complications and returned to her room .
Her hospital course was unremarkable .
Of note is the fact that her left leg was quite edematous postoperatively , likely due to the fact that her lymphatic system was interrupted and she had likely a venous thrombosis which is old in the left deep veins .
Her wound weeped serosanguinous fluid and was treated with dressing changes .
By the time of her discharge , her wound was significantly drier and she went home with dry sterile dressing changes only toher groin area .
She went home with staples intact due to the fact that she has poor wound healing secondary to chronic steroid use .
The patient had a Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse her entire hospitalization and her foot was warm .
There always remained asmall area of erythema in her forefoot , however , this was markedly improved .
Her gangrene stayed dry the whole time and she wastreated with 5 days of triple antibiotics .
During the hospitalization , the patient did develop a small flare in herarthritis , for which her rheumatologist was consulted and they increased her steroids for approximately 3 days .
The patient did well .
