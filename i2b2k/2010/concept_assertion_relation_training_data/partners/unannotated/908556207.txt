Electrocardiogram changes and prior history of coronary artery disease made her management necessarily cautious .

She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Her Vancomycin level was checked and was 9.8 .
She was subsequently re-dosed with 750 mg. on the 13th .
On heparin , her PTT was monitored .
The patient remained stable .
She refused blood draws and was somewhat difficult to manage in the absence of any end points and any ability to monitor her bloods .
The heparin was continued empirically for 48 hours .
She continued to have labile electrocardiogram changes .
Her enzymes were all negative .
Based on this , she was managed conservatively .
