ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
02-01-92 The patient is an 80 year old right-handed female who is a nun whose admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the 11th was the first for her .
She was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage presumed to have occurred nine days prior to admission .
She was admitted with confusion and a left internal carotid artery aneurysm present on MR angiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
On 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration .
She was transferred to a facility at Atl Mil , Maryland in Oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech .
She was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop .
She was then transferred to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia .
She did not reveal any meningismus .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and referred under the care of Dr. Telshey Peg by Dr. Rerhea T. Hearing of Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
includes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
includes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the Ona Hospital .
Apparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .
Bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .
Carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.
cholecystectomy in 1967 .
Hysterectomy in 1952 .
Right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .
FAMILY HISTORY :
was noncontributory .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
included Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .
ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .
HABITS :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
Chest was clear .
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
Calves were nontender .
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
Her face was strong and symmetric .
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
She sees light only od. which is chronic .
She reads large print os.
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
PROCEDURES :
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .
COMPLICATIONS :
There were no noted complications .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOW UP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .
