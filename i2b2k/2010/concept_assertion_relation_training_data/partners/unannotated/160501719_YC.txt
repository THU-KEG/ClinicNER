His cardiac cath was sig for complex anatomy w diffuse disease including diffuse 100% lesions in the SVG grafts to PDA and MARG1 , as well as 60% lesion in LIMA to LAD .
Given the difficult anatomy and unsure location of culprit lesion , pt underwent ETT-MIBI post-cardiac catheterization to localize area of possible ischemia .
Pt exercised 9 minutes on modified Bruce w only mild chest pressure at very end of test .
Images cw mild reversibilty at PDA territory cw diffuse lesion in SVG to PDA .
