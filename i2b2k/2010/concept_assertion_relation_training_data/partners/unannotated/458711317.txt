PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1. Recent upper GI bleed thought to be gastritis .
2. Post operative bleeding requiring a return visit to the Operating Room for control of bleeding .
In addition , it was thought that the patient probably exhibited tamponade physiology and a chest tube was left in place following that for several days .
3. The patient exhibited an episode of severe leukopenia thought secondary to Diuril .
The patient will be instructed no longer to ever take Diuril or any Thiazide diuretics .
4. The patient does have a history of diabetes .
5. The patient does have a history of carotid endarterectomies .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Sterpspardkotebaune is a 75 year old gentleman transferred from Shore Medical Center with three vessel coronary disease after having been admitted there on 11/17/98 for CHF and unstable angina .
The patient required intubation and aggressive diuresis .
The patient reports that he does feel much better .
He did rule in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and was treated with TPA .
He was transferred for CABG .
He had a recent carotid ultrasound which revealed no significant disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for coronary artery disease , CHF , recent upper GI bleed thought to be gastritis , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , glaucoma .
He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
Digoxin 0.125 once a day , enteric coated aspirin once a day , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Nitroglycerin paste q. six hours , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale and intravenous Heparin .
ALLERGIES :
On admission he reported no known allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed that his heart was regular rate and rhythm and he had distant heart sounds .
His lungs exhibited crackles throughout .
His abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds and benign .
His rectal exam did reveal guaiac positive stools most likely secondary to his recent upper GI bleed .
His extremities were unremarkable .
Neurologic exam was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a BUN and creatinine of 39 and 2.0 .
White blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit of 30 and platelet count of 215 .
EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm at 94 .
His catheterization done at the outside hospital revealed a 50% left main lesion , a 50% and 90% LAD lesion , a 90% circumflex lesion , 100% right coronary lesion and an ejection fraction of 25% .
The operation included the following :
1. On 11/26/98 the patient was taken to the Operating Room and had a three vessel coronary bypass done and a right coronary artery endarterectomy .
In addition , he had a repair to the left subclavian vein .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient did require insertion of intra-aortic balloon pump , however , after surgery .
On post operative day # 1 the patient was noted to have significant amounts of chest tube drainage of approximately 2.5 liters and was thought to exhibit some tamponade physiology .
He did have a left hemothorax .
He was taken back to the Operating Room for drainage of this and a chest tube was left in place following that for several days .
2. The second operation was a reoperation for bleeding at which time he had a mediastinal exploration and evacuation of hematoma .
The patient tolerated that procedure well and was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
The patient had the intra-aortic balloon weaned off on 11/28/98 .
On 11/29/98 it was noted the patient had an acute drop in his white blood cell count .
The lowest white blood cell count was 1.25 .
Hematology was consulted on this and they thought this was most likely secondary to administration of Diuril .
The patient was taken off the medication and his white blood cell count gradually began to rise .
On post operative day # 7 the patient had the one remaining chest tube removed .
COMPLICATIONS :
1. Post operative bleeding requiring return to the Operating Room for mediastinal exploration and evacuation of hematoma .
2. Profound leukopenia thought secondary to Diuril administration .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ( The Plavix is for the coronary endarterectomy . )
