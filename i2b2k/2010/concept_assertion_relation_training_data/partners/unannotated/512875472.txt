DIS
Admission Date :
04/26/1999
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
05/14/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) Breast cancer as per history of present illness .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) History of goiter , status post partial thyroidectomy .
( 4 ) History of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
( 5 ) ? history of transient ischemic attack times one in 1987 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
( 1 ) Atenolol 25 milligrams q.d.
( 2 ) Synthroid 0.125 milligrams q.d.
( 3 ) Multivitamins .

ALLERGIES :
She is allergic to quinine sulfate .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is an ex-smoker .
She occasionally drinks alcohol , and works as a baker .
She has a supportive partner , who works as a local fire fighter .
She had menarche at the age of 13 .
She is Gravida I , Para I .

Family history is negative for breast cancer .
Her maternal grandmother had colon cancer , and her grandfather had laryngeal cancer .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
GENERAL :
The patient is alert , pleasant , and in no acute distress .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 96.4 , blood pressure 120/90 , pulse 72 , saturations at 97 percent on room air .
She weights 81.8 kilograms .
HEENT / NECK :
Head and neck examination is notable for alopecia and thrush on the tongue .
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated .
CHEST :
Chest examination was clear to auscultation .

Cardiac examination was normal with a S1 , S2 , and a grade I to II / VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border .
ABDOMEN :
Abdominal examination was benign .
EXTREMITIES :
Examination revealed no edema .
No axillary lymphadenopathy .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 2.0 , hematocrit was 28.6 , and platelets were 308 .
Serum electrolytes revealed sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.6 , and glucose 77 .
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES :
Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 62 with a leftward axis and normal intervals .
She had a large R-wave in V2 , in V1 but with R less than S. She had an inverted T-wave in lead 3 , otherwise , no Q , ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a 48-year-old woman with high risk carcinoma of the breast admitted for a STAMP with cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin .
The patient was started on the standard protocol with day 0 being equal to December 1999 .
Her hospital course was , overall , uncomplicated and notable for the following events :
( 1 ) Hematology / Oncology :
The patient became neutropenic on day minus 2 and reached a nadir of white blood count of 0.02 on May 8 .
She had her first neutropenic fever on May 9 , 1999 , and all cultures from blood and urine are negative .
A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia .
The patient was started on ceftazidime initially for febrile neutropenia , but quickly developed a pleuritic rash .
She was put on piperacillin and gentamicin for enteric antibiotic coverage .
She recovered her count and was no longer neutropenic on May 11 , 1999 , which is day plus 8 .
On day plus 9 , she had a white count of over 10,000 and her antibiotic coverage was discontinued , as was the G-CSF .
During the patient &apos;s stay here , she required platelet transfusions on two days , and received two units of packed red blood cells on May 8 for a hematocrit of 25.7 .
The patient did not have very significant pain issues while in house , though , she did require a short course on a Fentanyl drip for management of throat pain .
She never developed severe oral mucositis that was appreciable , and her oral thrush was treated successfully with fluconazole .
( 2 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient was able to tolerate p.o.&apos;s throughout her hospital stay .
She did not have significant problems with marked electrolyte abnormalities .
On April 29 , she had a sodium of 132 , which was her lowest during her hospital stay .
Her sodium , subsequently , recovered with the administration of normal saline and p.r.n. doses of Lasix .
Overall , the patient has had a very smooth hospital course without complications , and was in stable condition upon discharge .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged home with services .
She will have SGGH services for line care and intravenous fluids .
She will receive one liter of normal saline plus 20 milliequivalents of KCl per day on Saturday , Sunday , and Monday .
FOLLOW UP :
Her follow up will include an appointment with Dr. Squarcnides on Tuesday , and then she will return to the Santusli Hospital on next Friday , May 21 .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
( 1 ) Atenolol 25 milligrams q.d.
( 2 ) Synthroid 125 micrograms p.o. q.d.
( 3 ) Folate 1 milligram q.d.
( 4 ) Multivitamin 1 tablet q.d.
( 5 ) Prilosec 20 milligrams q.d.
( 6 ) Compazine spansules 15 milligrams p.o. q.12h p.r.n. nausea .
