HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 67-year-old gravida 7 , para 7 white female with metastatic endometrial carcinoma who presented with increasing left lower extremity pain for pain management , anemia , diarrhea .
For her anemia , she received two units of packed red blood cells and tolerated this well .
Hematocrit was 29-30 after her two units of packed red blood cells .
For her increasing left lower extremity pain , she received a pain service consult .
Deep venous thrombosis was ruled out , negative lower extremity noninvasive tests .
The Pain Service started her on MSR Contin and Amitriptyline .
After a few days , she found great relief from her left hip pain .
She still , however , was unable to move it adequately with the aid of Physical Therapy .
She began having some hallucinations which she felt were real .
Psychiatry was consulted and they suggested stopping her Amitriptyline which was done and adding Haldol 1 mg at night and b.i.d. as needed .
Because she had increasing tremors and hallucinations .
Neurology felt that her hallucinations were also most likely due to pain medication and her tremors were enhanced physiological tremor and they suggested trying Mescaline at low doses .
It was felt that the MS Contin should be stopped and that she should be started on a PCA .
She was therefore started on a PCA with constant infusion of 0.3 mg / hour and a rescue dose of 0.1 mg every ten minutes times three doses / hour .
She was also started on Mescaline 60 mg p.o. q. day for her tremor .
Also , while in the hospital , the patient developed a Klebsiella pneumonia UTI for which she received seven days of Ancef because she continues to require an indwelling Foley , she was started on Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day as prophylaxis .
The patient &apos;s cultures from her stool returned positive for C-difficile toxin .
She was , therefore , started on 7-15-91 on Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
She will continue on this until 7-25-91 .
Her diarrhea has resolved on this medication .
The patient also underwent chemotherapy treatment during this hospital visit .
She first had a Hickman line placed for chemotherapy on 7-17-92 .
She tolerated this procedure well and the Hickman line has continued to function well .
She had a 24-hour urine which had a creatinine clearance of 57 and a normal RBG with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% .
Her chemotherapy was not started until 7-19-92 because the treatment had been started for her C-difficile .
By 7-20 , her diarrhea had resolved and she was started on chemotherapy .
She received Adriamycin 54 mg times two and 200 mg / meter squared of Carbo .
She tolerated this chemotherapy well .
She will get biweekly laboratory results followed .
She also was found to have Candida UTI and was treated for two days with Ampicillin , bladder irritation and follow-up culture was negative .
DISPOSITION :
It was felt that the patient required care facility placement and she will be continued on PCA for her pain management .
Therefore , appropriate chronic care facilities were investigated .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Triacetate 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day ; Dulcolax one p.o. q. day ; Aquaphor Cream to buttocks p.r.n. ; Senokot one p.o. q. day ; Vancomycin 25 mg p.o. q. 6 hours until 1-20 ; Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day ; Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. ; PCA allotted 0.3 mg / hour , rescue dose 0.1 mg every ten minutes three times an hour ; Mysoline 50 mg p.o. q. h.s.
