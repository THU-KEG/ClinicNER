DIAGNOSIS :
1. VALVULAR HEART DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was transferred from an outside hospital in Newssatden , admitted there 09/02/94 and transferred 09/05/94 .
The patient is a 55 year old woman who has long-standing untreated hypertension and known valvular heart disease .
Hypertension has not been treated for greater than 2 years secondary to side effects from medication , and the patient is on no regular medications and has not had regular medical care for 5 years since a previous Retelk County Medical Center admission for accelerated hypertension for which she was previously on four medications .
Cardiac risk factors include a positive family history of a postmenopausal patient but no cigarette use , diabetes or high cholesterol .
Previous echocardiogram in 1989 showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with 2 to 3+ aortic insufficiency , mild PS , no RWNA .
Recently in good health with no dyspnea on exertion .
Able to tolerate 2 1/2 hike , mountain climbing .
No recent history of chest pain , shortness of breath or congestive heart failure .
On 09/02/94 , the patient was playing with nephew and had sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and syncope .
Found by paramedics , unable to intubate in field .
Felt to have respiratory arrest related to aspiration and intubated at hospital in Tl .
The patient was rapidly revived with Lasix , Morphine and Nitrates .
Initial echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size , concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , possible anteroseptal hypokinesis , moderate to severe aortic insufficiency , PS-30 mm gradient .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction , hemodynamically stable , had minimal ventricular ectopy and had chest CT with lung infiltrate but no aortic disease and a normal head CT .
The patient was transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .

Liver function tests normal except for SGOT of 57 , LDH 229 .
CK &apos;s 85 , 94 , 137 .
All labs above from outside hospital .
Urinalysis normal .
EKG with normal sinus rhythm at 78 , LEH , left ventricular hypertrophy , deep T-wave inversions 1 and L , V3 through V6 .
Compared to 1989 , there were no T-wave inversions at that time .
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , enlarged left hilar shadow with a node that could be vascular or lymph node CT indicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s management was mainly for hypertension .
The patient was started on labetalol and increased Captopril with pressures 170 to 180 systolic .
No further symptoms .
Cardiac catheterization showed procedure done 09/08/94 :
Pulmonary valve stenosis with otherwise normal valve function .
RV pressure 80/10 , PAP 32/16 , peak pulmonary valve gradient 50 , mean gradient 30 , no significant aortic or mitral stenosis .
Aortogram 3+ aortic insufficiency , normal motion of leaflets .
Ventriculogram with mild left ventricular enlargement , normal contractile function .
RV gram :
No subvalvular stenosis and minimal coronary artery disease .
Left anterior descending has proximal 30 to 50% stenosis .
On admission also , the patient developed a temperature thought to be consistent with left lower lobe infiltrate seen at outside hospital with a peak white count of 17,000 and temperature reduction from 101.5 initially at the outside hospital to 100.4 here .
Blood urine cultures negative with chest x-ray as previously mentioned , clearing of infiltrate , thought to be chemical aspiration during syncopal episode .
The patient had one 10 beat episode of V-tach on admission with normal electrolytes at the time , and there was no further ventricular ectopic activity .
The patient &apos;s blood pressure regimen was adjusted so that her pressure by the morning of 09/09 was 170/72 with subsequent values of 120/80 and 150/76 , adequate saturations on room air and it was decided to discharge the patient with medical management , hypertension initially and then a reconsideration of treatment of the valvular disease once the hypertension is under adequate control .
The patient had an echocardiogram 09/09/94 showing moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , preserved systolic function , estimated ejection fraction of 55% .
Aortic valve was mildly thickened with moderate insufficiency , 1+ mitral regurgitation , mild LAE , normal RV size and function , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , elevated flow velocity , pulmonic valve of 3 meters per second consistent with peak gradient of 36 .
