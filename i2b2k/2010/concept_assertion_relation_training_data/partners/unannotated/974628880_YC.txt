RALDA ROOM TITCHEKOOPELKS MD
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a long standing history of peripheral vascular disease and tobacco use who has had multiple vascular procedures in the past including a fem-fem bypass , a left fem pop once above the knee with PTFE graph and then again below the knee with a refreshed saphenous vein graft as well as bilateral TMAs and a right fem pop bypass who presents with a nonhealing wound of his left TMA stump as well as a pretibial ulcer that is down to the bone .
The patient was admitted to obtain adequate pain control and to have any MRI / MRA to evaluate any possible bypass procedures that could be performed .
The patient &apos;s Coumadin was held and he was started on heparin drip in order to rapidly reverse him on time for an operation .
He remained in the hospital for the first two days and was unable to receive his MRI until hospital day # 4 at which time , the MRI and MRA showed no possible areas for a bypass graft and it was assessed that an above-knee amputation would be the proper operation to perform .
He was brought down to the operating room on 07/05/03 ; however , wished to wait another day , so his case was postponed .
The following day on 07/06/03 , he was taken to the operating room for a left above the knee amputation .
For a detailed description of the operative procedure , please refer to the dictated operative note .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to the PACU in a stable condition .
