Intraoperative findings revealed an incarcerated left femoral hernia , which was repaired under general anesthesia .
Her hernia sac contained only fat and fluid , and there was no incarcerated or ischemic bowel found .
Estimated blood loss was minimal .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
She had an unremarkable postoperative course during which she remained afebrile and stable .
She had some mild nausea that was controlled with anti-emetics , and received Percocet for pain control .
