Her pupils were ______________ ______________ owing to a right implant and a dense left cataract .
The right pupil was ovoid but reactive .
The left round , reactive from 4 to 2 millimeters .
The fundi were seen in the left and were normal .
OKN was present to the left but absent to the right .
She had a right gaze preference , full oculocephalics and full vestibular ocular reflexes .
Therewas a mild reduction of sensation at the side of the face and left cornea .
She had a mild left facial weakness .
The palate was midline but she had decreased gag .
The tongue was midline .
The weakness of her left side was greater in her arm than leg or face .
The left arm pronated and drifted less than three seconds .
There was motor impersistence .
There was decreased tone in the left upper extremity , increased tone in left lower extremity .
She had spontaneous ______________in the left lower extremity .
She did not localize deep pain on the left side .
She ______________ deep pain bilaterally , localizing on the right and withdrawing purposefully .
She did not attend to the left side examination .

LABORATORY DATA :
Admission sodium 142 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine 20/0.9 , glucose 138 , white blood count 10.3 , hematocrit 38.4 , platelet count 324,000 , prothrombin time 11.2/11 , partial thromboplastin time 27.3 and first CPK was 69 .
A chest X-ray demonstrated early interstitial edema and an I-head computerized tomography scan demonstrated atrophy at the vermis and cortex with early ______________in the high right parietal convexity and no hemorrhage .
There was no increased intensity in the vessels .
Her electrocardiogram demonstrated 63 beats per minute in sinus .
There was left ventricular hypertrophy , ST depression and T wave inversions in anterolateral leads , I , AVF , V4 to V6 .
IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION :
The patient is an 84 year old female with unstable angina pectoris , associated electrocardiogram changes , new right parietal stroke syndrome , sudden onset , might well have suffered from a cardioarterial embolism from ______________ thrombus .
Summary of laboratory and radiologic examinations :
serial cardiac enzymes did not detect a recent myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram demonstrated segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving left ventricular apex .
There were associated increased echo densities with the apex possibly representing ______________ or organized thrombus .

The carotid non-invasive studies demonstrated mild right internal carotid artery stenosis , bilateral external carotid artery stenoses , right greater than left , and severe left internal carotid artery stenosis as well asreduced flow in the left ophthalmic artery .
Repeat chest X-ray 4-17-94 demonstrated resolution of pulmonary edema following diuretics .
A magnetic resonance imaging study of brain on 4-15-94 demonstrated acute right middle cerebral artery infarction with attenuation of the distal M1 segment and paucity of vascular flow voids within the right sylvian fissure .
Multiple lacunes related to hypertension were present .
These findings were confirmed with MRA of circle of Willis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Her hospital course was smooth with a steady improvement in her left hemineglect syndrome , increasing interaction with the team , in particular when her son was around and increasing brightening .
For the first five days , she was nourished with tube feeds and then converted after Speech Pathology evaluation to a type II dysphagia diet which she eats with close supervision .
It was necessary to encourage minimal fluid intake of one liter per day .
Other investigations including liver function tests were normal .
A urinary catheter was inserted owing to urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence from ______________.
Repeated urine cultures were clear until 4-20-94 when a pan-sensitive E. coli urinary tract infection was documented .
There was no associated peripheral leukocytosis or fever but she was treated with Bactrim .
The night prior to discharge , she had a brief episode ( two minutes ) of central chest pain , not like her usual angina pectoris according to her son , which resolved immediately with sublingual nitrate and was not associated with any electrocardiogram changes .
She had a good night prior to transfer and prior to transfer had a left hemiparesis , with increased movement of the left upper extremity , was able to sit with little support of her trunk and was able to transfer to a chair .
The patient was eating a dysphagia 2 diet .
Her hemineglect syndrome had improved considerably .
