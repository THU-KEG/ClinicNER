restrictive pericarditis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease , prior myocardial infarction , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , ventricular ectopy , right bundle branch block and atelectasis .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
3-15-93 pericardiectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Levothyroid 0.1 mg PO q.day , Lasix 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Capoten 25 mg PO t.i.d. , Ecotrin 325 mg PO q.day , Iron sulfate 300 mg PO q.day , Insulin 18 units qam , and Lovastatin 20 mg PO q.day .

Her postoperative course was unremarkable except for episodes of arrhythmias .
Over the past three months , she has had progressive edema , ascites and right heart failure .
In January , she had cardiac catheterization and this demonstrated constrictive physiology and confirmed by chest computerized tomography scan in January , 1993 .
This demonstrated a suggestion that she had restrictive pericarditis and accordingly , she was deemed an appropriate candidate for admission for this purpose .
She had known ascites , bilateral pleural effusions , cardiomegaly , and increased interstitial markings .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

She has two children who are alive and well .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Her review of systems includes the edema , swelling and dyspnea .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , blood pressure is 100/70 in the left and 140/80 in the right , pulse of 68 and regular , neck veins not distended .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion except for bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular exam :
no murmur , rub or gallop .
The abdomen was distended with ascites .
Extremities :

The liver function tests were within normal limits .
Her prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were within normal limits .
Her hematocrit was 35% with a white blood count of 5900 .
Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block and multifocal premature ventricular contractions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .
There , the patient was seen in consultation by Cardiology and the Anesthesia Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Endocrine Service because of her insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on March 15 , 1993 , where Dr. Heart performed a pericardiectomy .
She had a good hemodynamic result .
The patient was then extubated within several hours after the procedure .
A thickened pericardium was noted .
She had relief of her symptoms , although she still had a propensity for heart failure because of her low ejection fraction .
She was monitored on the floor , the continued to show right bundle branch block and ventricular ectopy that required no therapy .
All her preoperative medications were resumed .
She ambulated and will be discharged home after seven days and will be followed by Dr. Heart in Ma Squiteton , along with Dr. Heart , who is her primary cardiologist .
