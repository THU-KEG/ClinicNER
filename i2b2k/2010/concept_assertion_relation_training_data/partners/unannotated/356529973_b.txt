SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1-19-93 bilateral neck re-exploration with right parathyroidectomy and right modified radical neck dissection .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old married female with nephrolithiasis , history of depression , bone pain , anorexia , insomnia , headache , nausea , fatigue , malaise , hypercalcemia , elevated PTH and history of pancreatitis .
Recent biochemical investigation revealed calcium of 10.4 , phosphorus of 2.6 and elevated PTH of 84 ( normal less than 60 ) .
An ultrasound examination of the neck was unrewarding .
Previous computerized tomography scan , magnetic resonance imaging study and Thallium scan showed a right paratracheal mass , consistent with persistent parathyroid tumor .
She has undergone previous parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma .
The patient is admitted at this time for further treatment of persistent primary hyperparathyroidism .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient is an anxious , middle aged female with a normal voice .
Her vital signs included a temperature of 96.9 , blood pressure 150/90 , respirations of 18 and heart rate 92 .
Neck examination reveals a thyroidectomy scar with no palpable thyroid bed masses or lymphadenopathy .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .
She has a right lower neck surgical clip visible on chest X-ray but nothing palpable in this region .
Breast examination reveals no lumps , skin changes or axillary lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm , with a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , well healed incisions but no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for a calcium of 10.4 , phosphorus 2.9 , alkaline phosphatase 76 , magnesium 1.7 , BUN and creatinine 10 and 0.7 , CA-125 11.1 ( normal less than 35 ) , sodium 143 , potassium 3.8 and chloride 107 , bicarbonate 25.3 , glucose 99 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , total bilirubin 0.5 , SGOT 15 , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 29.2 , platelet count 216,000 , white blood count 18.4 , hematocrit 41.1 , hemoglobin 14.2 , platelet count already mentioned .
The urinalysis , chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and on 1-19-93 , she underwent bilateral neck exploration with excision of a right paratracheal parathyroid adenoma , measuring 23 x 13 x 9 millimeters in size .
A limited right neck dissection was performed , removing multiple small cervical lymph nodes .
The left thyroid bed was examined , but no residual thyroid was identified .
A normal appearing left upper parathyroid gland was seen and preserved .
About 75 mg of the right sided parathyroid adenoma was cryopreserved should transplantation be necessary .
She underwent dilation and curettage under the same anesthesia .
Her calcium fell postoperatively , to 6.8 mg % and she developed paresthesias , requiring intravenous calcium .
Subsequently , the calcium stabilized with oral medication , 2 grams a day .
The calcium was fluctuating between 8.3 and 8.7 at the time of discharge .
During her hospitalization , she underwent gynecologic and neurological evaluation .
She appears to have a right sided ovarian enlargement with previous abnormal Papanicolaou smear requiring further investigation .
An ultrasound disclosed enlargement of the right ovary .
Papanicolaou smear previously documented psammoma body .
Repeat Papanicolaou smear studies are pending at the time of this dictation .
The curettage of the endometrium was nondiagnostic .
A computerized tomography scan and neurologic evaluation was consistent with migraine headaches and no other focal problems .
The patient had no hoarseness or airway problems .
Her sutures were removed on the third postoperative day .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Synthroid 0.125 mg PO q.day , Os-Cal 500 mg PO q.i.d.
She will remove the neck suture line steri-strips in one week and will follow up with Dr. Bone in his office in two weeks .
