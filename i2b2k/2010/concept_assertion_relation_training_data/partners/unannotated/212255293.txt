DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
8-24-92
DISCHARGE DATE :
9-9-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Post-infarction angina pectoris .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
chronic renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure , diabetes mellitus , carotid and peripheral vascular disease , hypertension , pernicious anemia , hypothyroidism , atrial flutter .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
coronary artery bypass grafting on 8-28-92 .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
gated blood pool scan on 9-3-92 , renal scan on 8-27-92 , renal ultrasound 8-27-92 ; carotid ultrasound 8-26-92 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78 year old male who was admitted to Pre Health on 8-19-92 with a complaint of chest pain .
He ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction and underwent cardiac catheterization .
This revealed a normal left main , a 60-80% diffuse stenosis with diffuse disease of the left anterior descending , a 90-100% stenosis of the circumflex and an occluded right coronary artery .
He was noted at the time of cardiac catheterization to have inferolateral and anteroseptal hypokinesis , with an ejection fraction of 30% and a wedge of 10 .
His hospitalization at Abo Healthcare was complicated by a single hypotensive event , responsive to fluids .
He was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 8-24-92 for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
remarkable for coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism , iron deficiency anemia , atrial fibrillation , hiatus hernia , gastritis , carpal tunnel syndrome , asbestos exposure , and bilateral cataract surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. ,
2. Nitrostat 0.4 mg sublingual prn ,
3. Isordil 20 mg PO q.i.d. ,
4. NPH insulin 24 units subcutaneously qa.m. ,
5. Ferrous sulfate , 325 mg PO q.day ,
6. Levothyroid , 0.125 mg PO q.day ,
7. Reglan 10 mg PO q.day ,
8. Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. ,
9. Vitamin B and folate injections .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly male who was not complaining of pain .
His vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters .
The carotids were without bruits .
Crackles were heard two thirds of the way up of the lung base on the right and one half the way up on the left .
Cardiovascular exam :
S3 and S4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted .
The point of maximal impulse was not palpable .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities :
within normal limits .
The neurological examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a sodium of 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26.9 , BUN and creatinine 45/2.5 , glucose 59 , white blood count 8.9 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 26.5 , platelet count 172,000 , prothrombin time 9.5 , partial thromboplastin time 27.8 .
The urinalysis revealed 10-20 white blood cells , 10-20 red blood cells .
Admission chest X-ray showed some cephalization of flow and an irregular right hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic T &apos;s in I , IV , V1 and T2 .
ST depression and biphasic T &apos;s were noted in V3 through V6 .
No Q waves were noted .
Picture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems .
He underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .
He also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .
The renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .
The impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient &apos;s renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .
No evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .
On 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .
Mr. Ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be followed closely by the Cardiology , Renal , and Diabetes and Cardiac Surgery Services .
The patient was then extubated on the second postoperative day in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He did have some trouble with postoperative hypertension , with systolics to the 150 &apos;s and was placed on Captopril , 6.25 mg PO t.i.d.
His blood pressure subsequently came under better control and his Captopril was discontinued .
His renal function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his BUN and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 .
Dr. Freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient &apos;s acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function .
On the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor , without incident .
He did well subsequently with good control of his blood glucoses and blood pressures .
The patient is being transferred to Nacalv Medical Center in stable condition , with his sternal wounds healing well .
His saphenous vein graft donor site has been seeping somewhat and his stitches and staples will remain in to be removed during his postoperative office visit .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
NPH 12 units and regular CZI 25 units qa.m. , CZI sliding scale prn , Digoxin .125 mg PO q.day , Ecotrin , 1 PO q.day , Ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg PO q.day , Reglan 10 mg PO t.i.d. , Synthroid 0.5 mg PO q.day , Lasix 40 mg PO q.day , potassium chloride prn .
Dr. Kotekeese , the patient &apos;s diabetes consultant , noted that the patient &apos;s morning regular insulin was new , and suggested that a premixed NPH regular 70/30 insulin might prove to be appropriate for him .
The patient &apos;s diet is a no added salt / no concentrated sweets diet .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Bun and with Dr. Shufffyfe .
