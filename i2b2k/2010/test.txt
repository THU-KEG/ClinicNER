at	O

the	B-TEST

We	O

continuing	O

On	O
the	O

the	O

developed	O

chest	B-TEST
x-ray	I-TEST
was	O

Hampton	B-PROBLEM
&apos;s	I-PROBLEM

Also	O
a	B-TEST

obtained	O
the	O
next	O

showed	O
high	O

PE	B-PROBLEM

So	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
heparin	B-TREATMENT
for	O
anticoagulation	B-TREATMENT
and	O
then	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
therapeutic	O
on	O
heparin	B-TREATMENT
,	O
we	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
coumadin	B-TREATMENT
and	O
she	O
is	O
currently	O
on	O
coumadin	B-TREATMENT
at	O
2.5	O

q.h.s.	O

Her	B-TEST
INR	I-TEST

We	O
want	O
her	B-TEST
INR	I-TEST
to	O
remain	O
between	O

So	O
if	O
it	O
goes	O
much	O
lower	O
than	O
2	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
would	O
consider	O
increasing	O
it	O
to	O
perhaps	O
coumadin	B-TREATMENT
2.5	O
and	O

alternating	O

a	O

all	O

happened	O
and	O
with	O
her	B-PROBLEM
hyponatremia	I-PROBLEM
and	O
also	O
the	B-PROBLEM
other	I-PROBLEM
problems	I-PROBLEM
,	O
her	B-TEST
blood	I-TEST
pressure	I-TEST
was	O
elevated	B-PROBLEM
also	O
.	O

We	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
nifedipine	B-TREATMENT
IR	I-TREATMENT
,	O
SL	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
control	O
her	B-TEST
blood	I-TEST
pressure	I-TEST
which	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
200s	O
in	O
the	B-TEST
systolic	I-TEST
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
atenolol	B-TREATMENT

So	O
on	O
discharge	O
she	O
is	O
on	O
atenolol	B-TREATMENT

If	O
needed	O
to	O
you	O
can	O
give	O
her	O
some	B-TREATMENT
nifedipine	I-TREATMENT

to	O
decrease	O
her	B-TEST
