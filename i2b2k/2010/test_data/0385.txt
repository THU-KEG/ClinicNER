HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness , who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms .
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .
However , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .
However , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .
A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .
However , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .
Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.
Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .
She was treated with a fluid bolus .
The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .
She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .
She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .
She denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .
A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .
An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .
Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .
It was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .
On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .
Her stress test was cancelled .
A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .
A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .
There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's Grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .
In addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .
It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .
It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .
A right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .
A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .
In addition , a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .
Therefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .
Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram .
Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram .
Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .
Therefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .
Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .
Therefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .
Plans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .
However , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .
Upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .
She described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .
The patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.
Review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .
The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .
Given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy .
On 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration .
During the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .
She had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .
In addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .
The patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .
This was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .
Because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy .
Flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
The patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .
Over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose .
The patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .
A high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .
Plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .
However , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site .
Surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .
A surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .
In addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .
Following this episode the patient felt like she was " too stressed " for pacemaker placement .
Therefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .
Over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .
She continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .
However , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .
On 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .
She had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .
The patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement .
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her Flolan therapy well .
She had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home .
She was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan therapy .
Following pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission .
However , she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
However , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed .
A urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .
Therefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a 10 - day course .
Following initiation of the antibiotic the patient 's white blood cell count quickly came down , and she remained afebrile .
At the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature .
She will complete two more days of Levaquin therapy as an outpatient .
3. RENAL :
The patient 's BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .
These remained stable and within normal limits .
It was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence , and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
4. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
She was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .
5. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient 's hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
Despite bleeding from the Hickman site , she did not require any transfusion therapy .
6. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits , being replaced as needed .
She was discharged to home on a regular diet .
7. ENDOCRINE :
The patient with a history of hypothyroidism .
She was continued on her regular Synthroid dose .
She will need a TSH and T4 checked as an outpatient .
8. CODE STATUS :
The patient is a full code .
9. FLOLAN ADMINISTRATION :
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a 6 - minute walk test .
On room air , the patient 's oxygen saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .
The patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies .
She was to follow up with Dr. Savage in the Clinic the following week .
