Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was admitted to Nantucket Cottage Hospital on 2013-03-27 following a motor vehicle crash as described previously .
Chest and pelvis X-rays were negative for fractures .
A CT of her head demonstrated intraparenchymal and extraaxial blood ( mostly subarachnoid ) in bilateral cerebral hemispheres , right greater than left , in a pattern indicating contrecoup injury .
A CT of her C-spine revealed a possible fracture of right C7 pedicle .
A CT of her chest revealed bliateral lung nodules and a right thyroid nodule .
A CT of her sinues revealed no fractures .
X-rays of her right lower extremity were negative for any acute injury .
A neurosurgery consult was obtained .
Our recommendations were to load her with Dilantin and then continue at 100 mg PO TID .
The orthopedics spine service saw her and put her in a C-collar .
She was admitted to the trauma ICU .
A repeat head CT 12 hours after the first was largely unchanged .
She was transferred to step down .
She was having some pain issues and morphine was making her " jittery ."
On HD 2 she was switched to Fioricet , which helped with her headaches .
A repeact head CT was unchanged .
An MRI of her C-spine was done to evaluate for ligamentous injury , but this was extremely limited examination due to patient motion and the signal in the spinal cord could not be adequately assessed for edema .
As per CMED CSRU spine , the patient was instructed to follow-up in 2 weeks for repeat X-rays .
On discharge she was awake , alert and orientated X3 with c/o mild headache .
She had full strength motor exam , no pronator drift and PERRLA with full EOM s.
She was ambulating without difficulties .

Follow-up in 1 month with neurosurgery for a repeat head CT was arranged .
