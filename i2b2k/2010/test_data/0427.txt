Blood cultures :
2019-02-01 ( 4 of 4 bottles ) E.coli
CXR : Pulmonary edema .
ECHO :
The left atrium is markedly dilated .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy .
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated .
There is  moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed .
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
Right ventricular systolic function is normal .
[ Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation .]
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened .
There is no aortic valve stenosis .
Mild ( 1+ ) aortic regurgitation is seen .
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present .
The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis .
No mitral regurgitation is seen .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
[ Due to acoustic shadowing , the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated .]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
Moderate [ 2+ ] tricuspid regurgitation is seen .
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .

Brief Hospital Course :
Pt is a 78 yo male with atrial fibrillation , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 transferred from the CMED CCU s/p intervention for cholangitis .
1) Acute cholangitis : Pt was admitted to the ICU , intubated , and ERCP performed , likely stone obstructing CBD .
Stent was placed and patient was treated with antibiotics ( Zosyn - > Ciprofloxacin ).
Per ERCP fellow , plan is for patient to return in four weeks to see Dr. Suzanne Davis , at which time he will likely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone .
If this is still problematic , pt may also need a sphincterotomy .
Dr.Demby secretary will contact patient at home the week after discharge to schedule this for the end of January .
Pt is to continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course .
2) Mechanical mitral valve : Anticoagulation was reversed for ERCP .
After this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip .
INR was 1.9 on discharge .
He was given sc lovenox x 1 and will continue this the day after discharge bid for one day .
VNA will check his INR at home and page his PCP with the results .
3) Atrial fibrillation : Rate controlled and on warfarin .
While in the hospital he had several episodes of pauses , none longer than 2.5 seconds .
His digoxin was held and his metoprolol was titrated down from his home dose .
Once the digoxin was no longer having effect , metoprolol was titrated back to home dose .
4) CHF : Pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course , CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema .
He was diuresed with lasix with good effect .
Volume overload likely ocurred in the setting of IV fluids given in the ICU .
Did not require lasix on discharge .
5) E. coli bacteremia / sepsis : Source of acute cholangitis as above .
Pt required 3 day stay in the surgical ICU and intubation as above .
6) Intubation : Pt was 97% on room air on arrival to Cindy , developed rapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated , but after that period of time required oxygen , presumably for pulmonary edema .
In the Lori pt was given 3L NS as well as 1 unit of FFP , and oxygen requirements contimued to climb .
In the CMED CCU pt was intubated for ERCP procedure .
He was extubated the next morning .

anticoagulation with a mechanical valve
Atrial fibrillation
Diabetes Mellitus
Congestive heart failure
Discharge Condition :
stable , will work with home PT
Discharge Instructions :
Please continue Ciprofloxacin antibiotic until 2019-02-14 .
Dr. Mcfarlane is the doctor who performed the procedure to place a stent in your bile duct ( a tube that drains the liver ).
His nurse is going to contact you at home to schedule a time for a repeat procedure to remove that stent .
You will have your blood drawn tomorrow ( 2019-02-10 ) by VNA .
It will be called in to Dr. Hamasaki office and he will call you to see how to change your coumadin .
You will also take lovenox subcutaneous injections tomorrow , 2019-02-10 .
You will take one if the morning and one at night .

Followup Instructions :
Dr. Mcfarlane is the doctor who performed the procedure to place a stent in your bile duct ( a tube that drains the liver ).
His nurse is going to contact you at home to schedule a time for a repeat procedure to remove that stent .
Before you have the procedure with Dr. Morris you will need to talk to Dr. Moya to see if you need to stop your coumadin / warfarin for a few days .
