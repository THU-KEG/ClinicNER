She has known allergy to penicillin , vancomycin and erythromycin .
She was evaluated upon presentation by the Maternal Fetal Medicine attending on call as well as by Cardiology .
She was found to have symptoms of congestive heart failure as well as decreased fetal movement .
Fetal monitoring initially on admission was appropriate for gestational age .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical exam , she was noted to have bilateral lower extremity edema , mildly elevated pressures in the 140 to 150/90 range , and jugular venous distension .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After consultation with Cardiology as well as Anesthesia on call that evening , it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for intensive monitoring .
Central IV access was obtained .
The patient was carefully diuresed over the next 48 hours .
Symptoms of congestive heart failure gradually abated over the next 48 to 72 hours .
The patient was given antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity .
A Neonatology consultation was obtained during the course of the hospitalization .
After discussion , it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester .
The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on 2014-05-19 at approximately 28 weeks gestation .
The cesarean section was performed on the West Campus in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite .
This was performed in this location in case any acute cardiac decompensation occurred during the time of cesarean section .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was on standby during the surgery .
The patient went to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit on the West Campus postoperatively .
She did well during the postoperative period .
She required several episodes of diuresis due to increasing shortness of breath on postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 due to worsening symptoms of shortness of breath from fluid shifts that normally occur during the postpartum period .
The patient was transferred to the West Campus on postoperative day #2 in stable condition .
She did well during the remainder of her postoperative course and was continued on her medication regimen that she had been on during the antepartum period .
She was discharged to home on postoperative day #4 .
