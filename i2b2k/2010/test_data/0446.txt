DIS
Admission Date :
09/16/2000
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
11/03/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
RUPTURED PARATHYROID ADENOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .
She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .
They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .
At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .
This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH-BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION :
Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
On transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and retired .
She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is intubated .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 98.6 , 66 .
Right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .
Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .
GENERAL :
She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
NECK :
Edematous .
Trachea was midline .
She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
The superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
LUNGS :
She had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with good bowel sounds .
It was nontender .
It was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
Both were easily reducible .
PULSE :
On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .
Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .
Her gas was 7.47/40/332 .
Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
It was consistent with a hematoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .
This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
There was no active bleeding at the time .
Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .
The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .
She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
This required a chest tube .
Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
In conclusion , by systems :
1. Neuro .
The patient became intermittently agitated .
We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
She responds well to this .
She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .
She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .
She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .
2. Cardiac .
The patient &apos;s blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .
This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .
Her blood pressure responds well to this .
Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .
This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .
Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .
The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
They elected not to inject it with thrombin .
They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
They have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. Respiratory .
At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .
Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
Her right lung field is clear .
Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .
Her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. GI .
The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .
This is her goal .
She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .
Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .
Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .
These have all been negative .
We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. GU .
The patient has had hypernatremia .
She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .
We believe her to still be total body overloaded .
Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .
We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .
This seems to trend her sodium down .
This will need to be monitored closely .
Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. Heme .
As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
She had no problems with this .
At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .
I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .
She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .
7. ID .
At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .
Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .
We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. Tubes , lines , and drains .
The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .
Her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .
