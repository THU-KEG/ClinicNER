HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 , who presents for elective right heart catheterization and pericardiocentesis .
The patient did well after his coronary artery bypass graft .
On 10-14 , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a new , moderate-to-large sized pericardial effusion .
The patient was asymptomatic at this time , and the decision was made to monitor him and to start him on Lasix .
The patient had follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on 11-04 which revealed a slightly large effusion .
A few days later , on 11-07 , the patient began to develop dyspnea on exertion with normal activity .
He also noted a new two to three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
On 11-08 , he had an episode of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure which he describes as different from his typical angina with minimal exertion .
The patient spoke with his cardiologist who referred him for pericardiocentesis for persistent and symptomatic pericardial effusion .
On right heart catheterization , the patient was noted to have elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 and a right atrial pressure of 16 .
After 600 cc of serosanguineous pericardial fluid was removed , the patient was noted to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a right atrial pressure of 2 ; indicating resolution of tamponade physiology .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 .
Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery to diagonal , saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal .
2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus for 50 years .
3. Hypercholesterolemia .
4. Hypertension .
5. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.1 to 1.4 .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient has a positive tobacco history , but he quit smoking over 20 years ago .
He is married and lives in Burbank Hospital .
He has retired .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , iron sulfate 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH insulin 18 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m. , Humalog sliding-scale q.a.m. and q.p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
The patient had a temperature of 100.9 .
He had a blood pressure of 148 to 162/45 to 54 .
He had a heart rate of 85 to 87 , breathing at 17 to 23 , satting 100% on room air .
In general , he was alert and in no acute distress .
His neck was supple without any jugular venous distention .
HEENT examination revealed his pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .
His extraocular movements were intact .
His sclerae were anicteric .
His mucous membranes were moist .
His oropharynx was benign .
Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm , heart sounds muffled , no murmurs .
Respiratory revealed bibasilar rales .
Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities revealed trace lower extremity edema , right greater than left , 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses .
He had 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally .
No hematomas were noted , but a soft right femoral bruit was heard .
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
The patient had a white blood cell count of 9.5 , a hematocrit of 34.5 , a platelet count of 194 .
His Chem-7 revealed sodium of 132 , potassium of 43 , chloride of 97 , bicarbonate of 28 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 1.3 , glucose of 220 .
He had an INR of 1.1 .
A calcium of 8.4 , phosphate of 2.5 , magnesium of 1.9 .
Pericardial fluid analysis was consistent with an exudative etiology .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
The patient had an electrocardiogram with normal sinus rhythm at 70 , normal axis , normal intervals , low voltage in the limb leads .
Chest x-ray on admission revealed a large left pleural effusion .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 11-10 which revealed the following :
Global left ventricular systolic function appeared grossly preserved .
Due to technical quality a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded .
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened .
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened .
There was a large pericardial effusion ( up to greater than 6 cm wide anterior to the right ventricle ).
The right ventricle was compressed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis .
He was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints .
He was continued on his home cardiac regimen , but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome .
Over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch .
By the next morning , the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours .
The patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following :
A trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis .
The pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty .
The pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge .
The patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film .
We decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis .
The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion , and 1150 cc of fluid were drained .
A chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion .
No evidence of pneumothorax .
On the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base .
He denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air .
He had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .
The patient was without any complaints and remained stable .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Condition on discharge was stable .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
The patient was to be discharged to home .
