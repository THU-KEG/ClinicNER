HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , and dilated cardiomyopathy ( with a transthoracic echocardiogram in 2016-01-13 showing an ejection fraction of 40% , posterior and inferior apical akinesis , and large left ventricular thrombus ).
The patient was admitted from 2016-01-21 to 2016-02-03 ; at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
She had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease with normal left main , mid left anterior descending artery 60% , diffuse 90% mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal , serial 70% and 90% left circumflex lesions , and 90% first obtuse marginal , and mid right coronary artery 60% .
During initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the right coronary artery stenosis was found ; for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent .
She was discharged on Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.5 to 3 .
She was then admitted again on 2016-03-30 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft .
At surgery , the descending aorta was noted to be calcified , and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intra-aortic pedunculated lesion .
Given the elevated stroke risk of aortic cross-clamping in the setting of this finding , the plan for a bypass graft was aborted .
The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
Social history is positive for smoking .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Physical examination revealed temperature was 99.3 , heart rate was 66 in a normal sinus rhythm , blood pressure was 132/51 , respiratory rate was 22 , and oxygen saturation was 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula .
Swan showed a PA of 29/11 , SVR of 14/9 , cardiac output of 3.86 , cardiac index of 2.14 .
Urine output of 30 cc to 100 cc per hour over the last four hours .
Chest tube showed 30 cc per hour over the last four hours .
In general , the patient was alert and oriented times three .
In no apparent distress and denied pain .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat examination was without bruits .
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm .
Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds .
No audible murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with active bowel sounds .
Extremities were without edema .
Neurologic examination was nonfocal .
Lines included a right antecubital peripheral intravenous .
Chest tube was in place in left internal jugular an pulmonary artery catheter .
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION :
Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 12.7 , hematocrit was 32.4 , platelets were 140 , and mean cell volume was 80 .
Patient was 4.4 , blood urea nitrogen was 14 , creatinine was 0.6 , and glucose was 147 .
INR was 1.2 , partial thromboplastin time was 23.7 , and prothrombin time was 13.4 .
Free calcium was 0.95 on 03-30 .
Phosphate was 3.6 and magnesium was 2.2 .
Arterial blood gas at 3 a.m. demonstrated 7.4/45/125 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit Service for Western Mass .
Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted .
The patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and statin .
Once the patient was titrated off dopamine , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted .
With regard to the left ventricular thrombus , her goal INR remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube
standpoint .
The patient remained comfortable .
By 04-01 , on postoperative day two , the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued .
The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place .
Likewise , on 04-01 , the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty .
Thus , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up .
In addition , the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation .
At this point , it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup .
The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 .
After evaluation and a discussion with Dr. Gunter , it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque , and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted .
At this point , the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for ) was no longer present .
The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 .
By 04-03 , captopril and atenolol were started , and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed .
The patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other symptoms .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Thus , the patient was discharged to home .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP :
The patient was to follow up with her primary care physician ( Dr. Desmet ) , as well as
with Dr. Gunter for an eventual percutaneous coronary intervention , and her surgeon ( Dr. Halcomb ) following her thoracotomy .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease ; 3-vessel disease .
2. Status post aborted coronary artery bypass graft due to mobile aortic atheroma .
3. Diabetes .
4. Hypertension .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Condition on discharge was stable and asymptomatic .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day .
2. Docusate 100 mg p.o. twice per day .
3. Fluticasone 2 puffs inhaled twice per day .
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. once per day .
5. Plavix 75 mg p.o. once per day .
6. Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. once per day .
7. Bupropion 100 mg p.o. twice per day ( for smoking cessation ).
8. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. once per day .
9. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once per day .
