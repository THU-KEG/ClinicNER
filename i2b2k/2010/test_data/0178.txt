HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Kacholera Junk was a 34 year old gentleman with no significant past medical history except for a history of of intravenous drug abuse .
He was status post a rehabilitation hospitalization at the Raya Ma Den Erinmarg Hospital with a recent recrudescence of his drug abuse .
He was admitted to the Sephsandpot Center on the morning of 4/9 and was subsequently transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further care .
The patient was apparently well until one day prior to admission .
His family reports that he had worked that day .
He relates using large doses of Cocaine and Heroin early in the morning on the day of admission .
At 3:00 a.m. on the day of admission he was found by the emergency medical technicians &quot; crawling on all fours &quot; , confused , and combative outside his home .
He gave an equivocal history of fevers and chills on the days prior to admission .
Bystanders report that he was assaulted about 20 minutes earlier and the nature of the assault was not known .
He was taken to the Sephsandpot Center where he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 105/85 , tachycardic with a heart rate to 186 , aneuric , hyperthermic , with a temperature to 105 degrees F , and progressively more confused .
His chest x-ray was clear .
He was treated with Dopamine for hypertension and Inderal for tachycardia .
He received two amps of Narcan .
He received one gram of Ceftriaxone intravenously after blood cultures were drawn .
His initial arterial blood gas at the Sephsandpot Center revealed a p02 of 76 , pC02 14 , and a pH of 7.44 on room air .
He was then transferred via Med Flight to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
He denied any history of recent travel .
Toxicology screen at Sephsandpot Center revealed Cocaine and Quinine .
Shortly after his arrival to that hospital he had been intubated for a respiratory rate of 60 .
He required medical paralysis for this .
He was reported to have a seizure , although the nature of this was unclear , and received Valium for this .

The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .
Chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .
