Service :
CCU
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Acute inferior myocardial infarction and right ventricular infarction .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old Caucasian-speaking woman with a history of hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use who developed waxing and waning left substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder on 2011-11-17 which lasted that entire day .
Upon waking on the morning of admission , she had 10/10 chest pain associated with nausea .
She presented to Charlton Memorial Hospital Hospital Emergency Department with inferior ST elevations ; at which time she became acutely hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 to 80 after receiving one ublingual nitroglycerin .
She then became bradycardic which responded to atropine and intravenous fluids .
In addition , she was given aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and morphine .
Immediately prior to transfer to Worcester State Hospital , she went into ventricular fibrillation arrest at 12:30 p.m. , at which time she was intubated and defibrillated back to sinus rhythm after five shocks .
She received an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg intravenously and was continued on an amiodarone drip while CMED CSRU-flighted to Boston Regional Medical Centerr where she underwent a catheterization .
The cardiac catheterization revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse right coronary artery disease .
She received three stents to the right coronary artery which was complicated by a proximal dissection .
She had good post percutaneous coronary intervention angiographic results .
Incidentally , an aortogram during the catheterization revealed a Debakey class I aortic ascending aneurysm , and the patient had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 at the time of catheterization .
She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in stable condition and still intubated .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypercholesterolemia .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
" Flumaran " for circulatory problems .
She receives this medication by mail from her relatives in Jill .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO CORONARY CARE 0408398 .
Amiodarone drip .
2. Integrilin drip .
3. Intravenous fluids .
ALLERGIES :
A question of a SULFA allergy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone in Woburn .
She came from Czech Republic 14 years ago .
She works as a nursing assistant in a nursing home .
She smokes approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Family history is not significant for any early history of coronary artery disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Examination on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed blood pressure was 100/57 , with a mean arterial pressure of 75 , heart rate was sinus rhythm at 75 , temperature was 97.6 , oxygen saturation was 99% on assist control with a tidal volume of 600 on 60% FIO2 , 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure .
In general , she was sedated at the time , responsive to stimuli , and was following commands .
She had moist mucous membranes .
Her carotids were 2+ bilaterally .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Her heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a faint second heart sound and second heart sound .
No audible extra heart sounds .
Her abdomen was obese and had positive bowel sounds .
It was soft and nontender .
She had peripheral edema with 2+ peripheral pulses bilaterally .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
Her laboratories at the time of transfer to Saint Vincent Hospital revealed white blood cell count was 11.5 , hematocrit was 42 on admission , platelets were 242 .
Chemistry-7 was unremarkable .
Creatine kinase on admission was 309 , with a MB of 19.6 , an index of 6.3 , and an initial troponin of 0.73 .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
A chest x-ray revealed an enlarged mediastinum with clear lung fields bilaterally .
Initial electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 , normal axis , 2-mm ST elevations in lead III , 1-mm ST elevations in aVF and V1 , 1-mm ST depressions in I and aVL ; consistent with an inferior and right ventricular infarction .
Right-sided electrocardiograms showed 1-mm ST elevations in V4 ; consistent with a right ventricular infarct .
Electrocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 84 , with a
normal axis , and normalizing of the inferior ST segments , with Q waves evolving in leads III and aVF .
An echocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed an akinetic inferior wall and right ventricle , mild mitral regurgitation , and ascending aorta measuring 5 cm .
There was no effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM :
On the night of admission , the patient experienced post catheterization hypotension which required intravenous fluids and dopamine .
Electrocardiogram the following morning revealed normalization of her ST segments with evolution of Q waves .
Her dopamine was weaned off the following day , and her heparin was discontinued secondary to a right groin hematoma which had developed after the sheath had been pulled out by the fellow .
Her creatine kinases climbed ; reaching a peak of 3523 , which was down to 1500 at the time of discharge .
Also noted on the day of 11-20 , the patient self-extubated herself .
For her coronary artery disease , status post catheterization , she was given Integrilin for 18 hours .
She was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor .
For her rhythm , amiodarone was discontinued as she was maintained in sinus rhythm after moving to the floor .
For pump , once transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit on 2011-11-20 , a beta blocker was begun at 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. b.i.d. which was titrated to 25 mg at the time of discharge .
Also , at the time of discharge , for increased afterload reduction , she was started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
On 2011-11-21 , the patient experienced atypical chest pain which was made worse with inspiration and movement .
It was not associated with any nausea or vomiting .
It did not radiate .
It was felt to be pain secondary to her self-extubation and noncardiac chest pain .
An electrocardiogram was checked which revealed no ST changes , and there was no increase in her downward trending creatine phosphokinases .
No further intervention was done .
The patient was treated with Tylenol orally as well as Ativan for anxiety that she had about going home .
She was pain free on the day of discharge .
Regarding her aortic ascending aneurysm , Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding further workup .
At their request , a CT scan of the chest with contrast was performed on the day of discharge .
Dr. Streeter from Cardiothoracic Surgery will follow up with the patient for further management in approximately one month as an outpatient .
His office will contact her to make that appointment .
2. PULMONARY SYSTEM :
As stated above , the patient self-extubated herself .
She complained of a sore throat which was likely the etiology of her atypical chest complaints .
This resolved with Tylenol and as needed doses of oxycodone .
Her lungs remained clear to auscultation bilaterally throughout the remainder of her hospital course .
At the time of this dictation , the CT of her chest was still pending .
The official result was not yet in .
3. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient 's electrolytes sere managed daily and repleted on an as needed basis .
She did receive intravenous K-Phos for a low phosphorous of 1.5 .
Her phosphorous rose appropriately to 3.6 at the time of discharge .
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :
1. The patient has an appointment to initiate primary care , as she no longer had a primary care physician .
Claire was to see Dr. Michael Majerowski at the Sturdy Memorial Clinic on the east campus , on Bissonette Six , in the South Suite , on 31-05-03 at 11:30 a.m.
2. In addition , as stated above , Dr.Hastings office from Cardiothoracic Surgery will be in contact with Ms. Williams to arrange followup for her ascending aortic aneurysm in approximately one month .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Condition on discharge was stable .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Inferior myocardial infarction and right ventricular infarction .
Status post cardiac catheterization and stents times three of the right coronary artery .
2. Hypertension .
3. Hypercholesterolemia .
