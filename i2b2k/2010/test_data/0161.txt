Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment :
68M with multiple vascular risk factors presents with acute onset right-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria , aphasia concerning for acute left MCA infarct .
Patient arrived in Daniel within 3 hours of symptom onset and head CT showed no evidence of bleed .
However , as wife had not seen patient before he became symptomatic , there was some concern that he had symptoms earlier than 6 am , and therefore would be outside the 3 hour window for TPA .
MRI was performed which showed diffusion abnormalities but no hyperintensity on T2 / FLAIR imaging supporting the acute onset .
Therefore , IV tpa thrombolytics were administered within 3 hours of symptom onset .
Within minutes the patient showed decreased right sided weakness and improved from a global aphasia to an anterior aphasia picture .
Given the likely embolic etiology of infarct , carotid doppler and TTE were performed .
Doppler revealed no hemodynamically significant lesions bilaterally .
Echo did not reveal potential source of emboli , but showed striking left ventricle akinesis and hypokinesis presumbly due to past MI x 2 .
Given that the stroke occurred while taking aspirin and plavix , and given the severe akinesis of the left ventricle , we decided to initiate anticoagulation with warfarin to help prevent future strokes .
Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with heparin and coumadin beginning on the evening of 2016-08-23 .
The patient and his wife , a nurse , were educated on low molecular wt heparin , which was started in the hospital on 2015-08-26 with close follow-up scheduled with Dr. Demmert of the Wareham VA primary care clinic the next morning .
His depakote was continued for his bipolar disorder .
On discharge , strength was nearly intact in the limbs , though he still had a right-sided facial droop .
Additionally , he still had mild dysarthria and mild anterior aphasia .
Additionally , risk factor modification was continued .
Lipid panel was checked and showed good control of lipids on his home dose of zocor .
Patient has no history of diabetes , and fasting glucose was 78 , but A1C was slightly elevated at 5.9 .
He may need further glucose monitoring in the future .
His home hypertensive medications were held while in the hospital to help increase cerebral perfusion and prevent further ischemia .
They will be restarted on discharge .
Speech therapy was also consulted , and recommended oupatient speech therapy .
Similarly , outpatient PT was recommended for his gait difficulties from his previous strokes .
Residual deficits include right side facial droop from previous stroke and moderately severe dysarthria and anterior aphasia with word finding difficulties .
