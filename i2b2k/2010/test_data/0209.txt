HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 25 - year-old gentleman who is status post a motor vehicle accident in which he was the unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole .
He was ejected from the car and landed on his face .
Extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders .
It was presumed high-speed motor vehicle collision .
The patient was CMED-flighted to Quincy Medical Center , and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department .
After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation , a CT scan was performed .
Images of his head , abdomen , and thorax were obtained .
His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures , a right temporal fracture , bilateral frontal contusions , and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma .
The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells , presumably caused air in the orbit .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Initial examination revealed the patient had a heart rate in the 80s , with a blood pressure of 150/80s .
He was intubated with multiple abrasions , and severe swelling and contusions of his face .
He was not following commands .
His Boston Coma Scale was 16 .
His pupils were reactive on the right going from 3 mm to 2 mm of light .
The response was brisk .
On the left , his pupils went from 2.5 mm to 2 mm , also brisk .
Initial evaluation revealed corticate posturing was noted by the trauma team .
He withdrew equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .
He withdrew to noxious stimuli equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. NEUROLOGY :
Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay .
Upon arrival , Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt .
This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .
Notably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .
During his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .
To do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .
While using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .
In addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg .
A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .
Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .
Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .
During his hospitalization , two subsequent CAT scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .
This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .
After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .
His intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .
An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three .
This examination was unchanged from the previous examination .
Again , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As described in previous section , Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .
This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .
Please see Infectious Disease section for more details .
3. GASTROINTESTINAL :
Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .
A orogastric tube was passed .
Initially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .
However , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .
This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .
Gastroenterology was consulted for this .
Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .
At this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.
4. HEMATOLOGY :
Throughout Mr. Richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .
As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .
Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .
He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .
An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .
5. ENDOCRINE :
Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .
His blood urine and sputum were all cultured .
Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .
His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli .
Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .
Throughout this time , Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .
During his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and Flagyl .
Initially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .
He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl .
Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .
With a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .
Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .
7. PULMONARY :
As discussed in the Infectious Disease section , Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from Escherichia coli .
For this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
On hospital day three , Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .
For this , a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .
On hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .
For this , a left #34 Caucasian chest tube was placed .
On the evening of hospital day four , Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .
Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated .
The measures included attempts at pacing .
Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .
He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .
During the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .
There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .
During this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .
A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present .
After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .
Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .
After the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .
Permission for a postmortem examination was granted .
