SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , the patient had what appeared to be acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community - acquired pneumonia .
She was maintained on a ventilator and ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol .
For antibiotic coverage of her pneumonia , she was started on Levaquin , ceftriaxone , and vancomycin .
Over the next two days after admission , the patient 's vent settings were gradually weaned , and she was extubated two days after being transferred to this hospital .
After extubation , the patient was oxygenating well on face mask .
She did continue to have a persistent fairly severe cough ; however , her cough was weak due to abdominal muscle pain from repeated coughing .
The cough was mostly nonproductive .
The patient was breathing comfortably .
As there was no identified bacterial pathogen on any cultures , the patient was continued on the triple antibiotics for first several days of the hospitalization .
She was also on round-the-clock Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers .
Once the patient was transferred out of the ICU and after extubation , the antibiotics were gradually narrowed .
The vancomycin and Levaquin were discontinued after approximately four days in the hospital .
The ceftriaxone was discontinued after four days in the hospital , and the patient was to continue on Levaquin .
The patient had gradual improvement in her oxygenation .
Pain control :
The patient had fairly significant abdominal pain secondary to persistent cough .
She was started on a regimen of MS Contin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain .
This helped her somewhat though she has continued to have difficulty coughing due to the pain .
Tylenol and ibuprofen were also added for better control .
Transaminitis :
The patient was noted to have mild transaminitis on admission .
However , this was felt to be due to her significant infection .
This should continue to be followed as an outpatient to assure that it returns back to normal .
Anemia :
The patient 's reticulocyte count showed inadequate production .
Iron studies showed a mixed picture with decreased iron and decreased iron to TIBC ratio suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia , but also normal to high MCV .
B12 was noted to be low and the patient was given an injection of IM B12 while in the hospital .
She was also started on iron supplementation .
Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on Synthroid for her chronic hypothyroidism .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
The patient was discharged home with services .
