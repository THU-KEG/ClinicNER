He was watched after his initial diagnosis , but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic .
After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90% involvement of his intratrabecular space .
He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan .
After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state .
However , he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy .
He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08/22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed .
He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest , and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation .
