She was also noted to have a cold distal left upper extremity which was operated on and she is now status post left brachial artery embolectomy .
Throughout her course on the Intensive Care Unit service , she has remained unresponsive with imaging studies consistent with a large left middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery distribution cerebral infarction with mass effect and midline shift .
