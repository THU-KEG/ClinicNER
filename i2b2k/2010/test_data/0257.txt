She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient 's urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC 's .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC 's in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC 's in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .

At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC 's were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
