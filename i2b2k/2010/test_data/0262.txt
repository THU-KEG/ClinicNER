The patient is an 87-year-old male with stage D prostate was cancer , was admitted for fluid hydration on the 10th of March .
The patient was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer in August of 1989 .
He presented with gross hematuria at that time .
Subsequent prostatic biopsy revealed a Gleason 's IV , plus V tumor and the CT showed an irregular large prostate with tumor invasion into the bladder and evidence of bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node spread .
There was also evidence of bone metastasis at that time .
The patient was admitted in October of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and Foley catheter placement .
Over the past one month prior to admission , the patient 's wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the preceding two weeks .
The patient has been lethargic and bed ridden for the past two weeks , although there was no evidence of fever or chills over this time .

LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.' s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient 's fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient 's electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.' s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to El Hospital , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient 's p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient 's p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient 's urinary obstruction will be addressed .
