Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
12/17/93
CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient &apos;s increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient &apos;s prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient &apos;s rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .
