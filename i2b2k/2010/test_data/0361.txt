CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Renal failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol who presented for a lower extremity peripheral angiography for bilateral foot ulcers , and he was found to an evaluated blood urea nitrogen , and creatinine , and potassium .
The patient notes he developed worsening foot pain and ulcers four months ago .
Due to his worsening blood glucose , he was started on insulin .
His foot ulcers continued to develop , and the patient complained of pain in his feet ; primarily at night .
The patient was referred to for Vascular consultation because of the ulcerations and pain and scheduled for a lower
extremity angiography on the day of admission , but due to his renal failure the procedure was cancelled .
The patient showed peaked T waves on electrocardiogram , and he was transferred to Medicine .
The patient denied any oliguria , hematuria , dysuria , foamy urine , flank pain , abdominal pain , or urinary hesitancy .
He has complained of fatigue , anorexia , and a 10-pound weight loss in the last four months .
He gets short of breath with one flight of stairs .
He denies any fevers , chills , recent infections , chest pain , orthopnea , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , hematemesis , melena , or hematochezia .
The patient also notes he has had hoarseness for the last two to three weeks .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
On admission , temperature was 98.1 , blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse was 95 , respiratory rate was 18 , oxygen saturation was 98% on room air .
In general , the patient was a thin white male , lying in bed , in no acute distress , with a hoarse voice .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light and accommodation .
Extraocular movements were intact .
Sclerae were anicteric .
Mucous membranes were moist .
Neck revealed no lymphadenopathy .
No thyromegaly .
No jugular venous distention .
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm .
Normal first heart sound and second heart sound .
A 2/6 systolic murmur at the upper sternal border .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with faint lower lobe crackles on the left .
Back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
No rebound or guarding .
No hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities revealed 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally , 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally .
No lower extremity edema .
Left foot with a dry crusted ulcer over the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head and the lateral posterior heel .
On the right foot dry crusted ulcer over the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head and medial posterior heel .
Neurologic examination was grossly intact .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
On admission , white blood cell count was 11 , hematocrit was 30 , platelets were 269 .
Sodium was 139 , potassium was 6.1 , chloride was 102 , bicarbonate was 18 , blood urea nitrogen was 100 , creatinine was 2.3 , and blood glucose was 189 .
FENa was 0.37 .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
Renal ultrasound was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is an 83 - year-old male with a history of diabetes , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol without presented to the hospital for lower extremity angiograph ; however , that was deferred due to new onset renal failure .
1. RENAL FAILURE :
The patient was initially thought to be prerenal , and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake .
He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis .
His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay , and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease .
During his hospital stay , he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
He also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection .
The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine .
After being treated with lidocaine , the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit .
His nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip .
It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02 .
A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior .
He had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted , and due to the patient 's acute illness , they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated .
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia .
He was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone .
He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors .
Of note , he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay .
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output .
The patient 's family eventually decided to withdraw care , and the patient was extubated and passed away on 2009-07-12 .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection .
He then developed positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin , and that was continued .
When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors , his antibiotics were broadened , and he was put on stress-dose steroids .
He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .
3. PULMONARY :
The patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia .
He was actually extubated on 07-09 , but then reintubated one hour later due to hypoxia .
He was also found to have a bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
On 07-12 , after and extensive family meeting , the family decided to extubate the patient and make him comfortable , and he passed away at 5:20 on 2009-07-12 .
