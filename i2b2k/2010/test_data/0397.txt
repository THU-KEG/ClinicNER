Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Chester was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and underwent routine preoperative evaluation .
He remained pain free on medical therapy .
Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery .
On 04-18 , Dr. Oneill performed off pump coronary artery bypass grafting .
For surgical details , please see seperate dictated operative note .
Following the operation , he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring .
Within 24 hours , he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident .
Given hypotension and bradycardia , he was slow to wean from Neosynephrine .
Low dose beta blockade was eventually resumed .
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication .
On postoperative day three , he transferred to the SDU .
He maintained a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias .
He remained in sinus bradycardia ( rate 50-60 ) and tolerated low dose beta blockade .
On POD #6 his creatinine became slightly elevated at 1.4 , his lasix was discontinued and the following day his creatinine was stable at 1.4 .
He continued to progress and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 7 .
His discharge chest x-ray showed persistent bibasilar atelectasis with only tiny pleural effusions .
Of note , he will need to remain on Plavix for three months postop given the off pump procedure .
In addition , he will need to remain on Imdur given use of his right internal mammary artery as a " free " arterial graft in preventing 
vasospasm .
