While on transfer , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization .
Please see cathed report for full details .
In summary , the catheterization showed left main with no obstructive disease , LAD with 70 percent serial lesion , left circumflex with 70 percent proximal , OM1 and OM2 both 70 percent lesions , RCA with nonobstructive disease and ejection
fraction of 25 percent .
The patient was referred to CT surgery who was seen and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting .
On 09-06 , he was brought to the Operating Room , please see the Operating Room report for full details .
In summary , he had a coronary artery bypass graft times 4 with a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft OM1 , saphenous vein graft OM2 and saphenous vein graft of the diagonal .
His bypass time was 105 minutes with a cross clamp time of 87 minutes .
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the cardiothoracic ICU .
At the time of transfer , he was AV paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute .
He had Propofol at 30 mc per kg per minute and Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure .
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period .
His anesthesia was reversed .
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his operative day .
On postoperative day 1 , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain an adequate blood
pressure .
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit as he was unable to be weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine drip .
On postoperative day 1 , his Swan-Ganz catheter was removed as well .
On postoperative day 2 , another attempt was made to wean the patient off of Neo-Synephrine unsuccessfully .
His chest tubes were removed .
However , because he could not be weaned from the Neo-Synephrine , he again remained in the Intensive Care Unit .
On postoperative day 3 , an additional attempt was made to wean the patient from his Neo-Synephrine unsuccessfully .
The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells in an additional attempt to wean from Neo-Synephrine .
This also did not help in the attempt to wean from Neo-Synephrine .
His Foley catheter was removed and he remained again in the ICU .
On postoperative day 4 , additional attempts were made to wean the patient off of his Neo-Synephrine , however , he continued to drop his blood pressure whenever an attempt was made .
Other than that , the patient remained completely stable .
On postoperative day 5 , the patient was finally weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine and diuresis was begun .
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for an additional day to monitor his hemodynamics .
On postoperative day 6 , the patient remained hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .
Over the next two days , the patient had an uneventful hospitalization .
His activity level was increased with the assistance of physical therapy department and the nursing staff .
