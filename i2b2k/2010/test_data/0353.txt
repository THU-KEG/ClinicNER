Assessment and Plan :
This is a 79 y/o M with h/o HTN , DM , recent CVA , chronic ventilatory failure , CRI on HD who presents with change in MS and febrile in the Amanda , admitted to CMED .
# Altered mental status : Ct scan with no evidence of new intracraneal bleeding .
Patient febrile in the Amanda .
High WBC .
It was thought that it could have been a combination of hypotension , hypercapnia and infection .
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics .
Despite having a profund limitation communicating given his neurological status , his mental changes seemed to improved initially .
However later on during his course , his mental status deteriorated , being even less responsive .
# ID :
Patient febrile and with a high WBC on admission .
After starting broad spectrum antibiotics - cefepime - vancomycin and flagyl ( for initial concern of aspiration pneumonia ), he responded clinically .
Urine cx from Rehab showed gram negative rods > 100 K enterobacter cloacae .
Urine Cx in house grew Citrobacter Freundi and his sputum grew Acinetobacter Baummani .
Since there was no more evidence of gram positive infections , vancomycin was discontinued and cefepime was kept .

Also possible source sinus infections given findings on intial CT ( see summary in significant studies ). He did not spike any fevers after being transfer to the CMED from the Amanda .
