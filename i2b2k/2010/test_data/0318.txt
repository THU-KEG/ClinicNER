HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was directly admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
Coronary angiography , right heart catheterization and percutaneous intervention of the RCA were performed from the right groin without complications .
The proximal RCA was totally occluded with good left to right collaterals .
The LAD showed a 40% stenosis in the proximal segment .
The circumflex showed mild atherosclerotic .
The RCA occlusion was successfully dilated and sent using a 3.0 X 23 mm Duet with post stent dilatation up to 16 atmospheres .
Following intervention right heart catheterization was performed to rule out RV infarct .
The RA was 5 .
PA was 19/7 with a mean of 13 .
PCW was 11 .
Of note there was a clear A wave in the RV tracing , suggestive of RV infarct .
The next day the patient was quite confused and disoriented , which gradually disappeared .
An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the LV function , which showed an ejection fraction of 53% with inferoposteriorakinesis / hypokinesis .
The next day the patient &apos;s mental status came back to baseline and he remained free of angina .
