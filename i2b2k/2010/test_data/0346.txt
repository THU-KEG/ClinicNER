He also had an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .

In general , he is a well developed , well nourished man breathing easily , in no acute distress .
Skin :
multiple stigmata of burns on the left arm and chest .
On head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , fundus was sharp , oral mucosa was clear .
Neck :
no jugular venous distention at five centimeters , neck was supple , full range of movement , no bruits , no adenopathy .
Lungs had bibasilar rales 1/4 of the way up bilaterally , otherwise clear .
Cardiovascular exam :
II / VI systolic ejection murmur at left sternal border , positive S3 , question of S4 , otherwise point of maximal impulse was laterally displaced .
Abdomen :
surgical midline incision and previous surgery for history of gastric ulcer .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , mildly obese with liver edge two centimeters below the right costal margin .
Extremities :
no evidence of clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination was trace guaiac positive .
The patient had pulses distally , 1+ femorals , 1+ dorsalis pedis .
The neurological examination was otherwise nonfocal with mentioned left upper extremity 3/5 strength with pain and 5/5 on the left lower extremity .
LABORATORY DATA :
Admission hematocrit 44 , BUN and creatinine of 13 and 0.9 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time normal .
The patient had a chest X-ray which showed mild pulmonary edema .
The electrocardiogram showed Q waves in V1 through V6 , T wave pseudonormalization in V1 through V6 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with CPK maximum on hospital day number one peak of 186 and iso of 23.8 and index of 12.8 on September 2 , 1994 .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs for Dr. Churlaunt of Cardiology .
The patient received the appropriate protocol for myocardial infarction , intravenous heparin , aspirin , and beta blockers for rate and blood pressure control .
The patient on the date of September 5 , 1994 had cardiac catheterization which showed normal resting hemodynamics .
The patient has a small non-dominant right coronary artery , left anterior descending showed severe proximal lesion with more distal lesions of diagonal one .
The left circumflex was dominant with severe disease of obtuse marginal one , with moderate mid-circumflex stenosis and moderate posterior descending artery lesion .
The left ventriculography shows anterior akinesis and apical severe hypokinesis with a moderately depressed ejection fraction , cardiac output of 3.9 , index of 2.0 .
The patient was seen in consultation by Cardiac Surgery for evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting .
The patient had stable hematocrit of 38% on intravenous heparin .
The carotid noninvasives preoperatively were negative .
Dental consult was negative .
On the date of September 11 , 1994 , patient underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery , circumflex and diagonal and left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
The patient had a bypass time of one hour and fifty minutes with good urine output and pre-bypass cardiac output of 4.0 , post-chest closure 5.3 , arrived to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on Nipride , Lidocaine of 1 and Fentanyl/ Versed of 10 .
The postoperative hematocrit was 26% .
The patient had a routine postoperative course in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with a postoperative BUN and creatinine of 11 and 1.2 with good urine output of over 100 an hour and patient received two units of packed red blood cells , fresh frozen plasma and platelets for increasing chest tube drainage .
The patient on the date of postoperative day number one , September 13 , 1994 , was transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit up to the FIH 18 floor .
The patient &apos;s only post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit course was remarkable for hypertension requiring Nipride and bleeding which was controlled with fresh frozen plasma , platelets .
The patient had a stable hematocrit of 30% with CPK &apos;s postoperatively maximum MB fraction of 78 .
On postoperative day number three , patient went into atrial fibrillation , which was treated appropriately with metoprolol and digoxin and converted back to sinus rhythm .
The patient continued to need diuresis .
The postoperative medications up on FIH were Coumadin , baby aspirin , Isordil 10 PO t.i.d. , Digoxin .25 q.day , metoprolol 25 PO b.i.d. ______________
Chest tubes and wires were all discontinued according to protocol on postoperative day number four .
The Isordil was also discontinued .
The patient &apos;s incisions sternal and right leg were clean and healing well , normal sinus rhythm at 70-80 , with blood pressure 98-110/60 and patient was doing well , recovering , ambulating , tolerating regular diet and last hematocrit prior to discharge was 39% with a BUN and creatinine of 15 and 1.0 , prothrombin time level of 13.8 , chest X-ray prior to discharge showed small bilateral effusions with mild cardiomegaly and subsegmental atelectasis bibasilar and electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement and no acute ischemic changes on electrocardiogram .
Note :
patient needs anticoagulation for large saphenous vein graft to prevent any possibility of thrombosis .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with his cardiologist and will follow up with Dr. Hemp and Dr. Signs .
