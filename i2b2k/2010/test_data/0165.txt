Imaging :
1. Nexk CT :
Increased soft tissues within the pharynx .
This may be secondary to soft tissue swelling as indicated in the patient 's history , and some may be secondary to secretions above the ETT balloon .
No retropharyngeal fluid is identified .
Dependent atelectasis is present within the visualized portions of the lung apices .
2. Chest CT :
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations mostly in dependent portion , with small pleural effusion and diffuse ground-glass opacity in bilateral upper and lower lobes , consistent with ARDS with pulmonary edema given the history .
Ground-glass opacity is somewhat more prominent in right upper lobe , and superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded .
Brief Hospital Course :
This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic respiratory failure .
1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure :
She arrived intubated and sedated from Esteban Hospital .
On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar and bibasilar opacities , which appeared conistent with pulmonary edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia .
There was no evidence of ARDS .
She was known to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum at the outside hospital .
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA .
She was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia .
A CT scan was performed on 07-17 to evaluate the soft tissue swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital .
The CT showed increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be secondary to prolonged intubation / trauma .
She was treated with steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital , and these were continued .
It was decided that patient should receive one more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy .
She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to delay extubating the patient until the morning of 6/2 .
Overnight , the patient became hypoxic , dropping to the 80 's .
A chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high in the trachea .
The cuff was deflated and the patient was extubated .
She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask and her sats immediately improved .
She was weaned down until she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by nasal cannuala .
As she was doing well without evidence of stridor , the steroids were stopped .
She did well and was weaned from supplemental oxygen .
At the time of discharge , she was oxygenating well on room air .
She Will need to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on 2019-07-30 .
2. Enterobacter bacteremia :
She was initially covered broadly with vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , and falgyl .
She had positive blood cultures at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for gram negative rods .
Subsequently , zosyn was added .
The cultures grew out enterobacter cloacae .
It was unclear the source of her bacteremia .
Her stool cultures were negative .
Her central line was removed and the tip was culture negative .
She was transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia .
She had no positive cultures during this admission .
Once she was more stable , an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess .
This study was negative .
However , the study was limited due to inadequate po contrast intake by the patient ; it did show a question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel .
This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po 's .
She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her bacteremia on 2019-07-30 .
3. Diabetes type I :
She was intially maintained on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
She was followed by Albano during the admission .
She was initially maintained on D5W , which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip .
Once she began to take PO 's , the insulin drip was stopped and patient was started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale .
While her po intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV dextrose to suppress ketosis .
While she was on the IV dextrose , she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control .
As she starting taking some foods , her glargine was decrease .
At the time of discharge her glargine was 10 .
Her blood glucose were under good control .
The day prior to discharge , she was nauseated and not taking pos .
Therefore , she received 1L of D5 , and her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge .
4. Gastroparesis :
She has a history of gastroparesis secondary to long-standing type I diabetes .
Once she was extubated , she was nauseated with emesis .
She was intially treated with erythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to reglan in the past .
She continued to remained nauseated so she was treated with phenergan , anzemet , zofran , and ativan .
She intermittently was able tolerate pos .
Her nausea was accompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with morphine .
She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain control .
She continued to have nausea despite an agressive anti-emetic regimen .
It was felt that her symptoms were secondary to gastroparesis .
However , other causes were looked for including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction .
She had a normal cortisol stimulation test .
A abdominal plain film showed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an early obstruction .
A NG tube was placed for decompression given the signs of early obstruction the day of transfer .
The GI service was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all gastroparesis .
They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm .
She should eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out celiac disease .
5. Transaminitis :
Per report , She had elevated LFTs at the outside hospital .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and was negative for any acute pathology .
Her LFTs trended down during this admission .
6. Hypothyroidism :
She was maintained on her levothyroxine .
While she was not taking adequate pos , she was on IV levothyroxine .
7. F/E/N :
She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings for nutrition .
After extubation , patient was started on sips and had a speech and swallow evaluation .
She was cleared to advance her diet as tolerated .
She only tolerated some clear liquids .
At the time of transfer , she was NPO given her NG tube .
8. Prophylaxis :
PPI , Heparin SQ .
9. Access :
Her central line was removed given the concern for a line infection .
She had a double lumen PICC place .
10. CODE :
FULL
11. Dispo :
