Echo : The left atrium is mildly dilated .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF 70% ).
There is no ventricular septal defect .
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied .
The right ventricular cavity is dilated .
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed .
The aortic arch is mildly dilated .
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch .
There are three aortic valve leaflets .
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened .
There is at least moderate aortic valve stenosis .
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present .
The gradients are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis .
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .
Compared with the findings of the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2013-06-18 , the pressure gradient across the mitral valve prosthesis is increased .
IMPRESSION : AP chest compared to 07-30 through 26 : Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged .
Bilateral pleural effusion small on the right and moderate on the left is stable .
Severe cardiomegaly and left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged .
No pneumothorax .
Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement .
ECG : Ventricular paced rhythm .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder , AF , and h/o CAD a/w hypercarbic respiratory failure .
# Respiratory failure - She was admitted to the CMED CSRU for her repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF .
Pt was diuresed with iv lasix / acetazolamide and given iv morphine / prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried .
However , hypercarbia ( 04-11 metabolic alkalosis ) remained in the 90s .
Pt was mentating okay , having conversations with intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia .
TTE showed preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN .
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS Harold Holcomb to her pulm edema and pulm HTN .
Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin and starting amiodarone .
Family declined valvuloplasty .
For possible COPD , pt was started on steroids and nebs on 08-03 .
Pt is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but needs more O2 when supine .
Pt is a mouth breather and occasionally needs a face mask .
Pt will need I/Os monitored to goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during her CMED stay .
Depending on her I/O , lasix and acetazolamide can be decreased or discontinued .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readdressed .
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes .
Pt was continued on BB , ASA , and nitrates .
# Acid / base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation .
Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today .
Pt failed BIPAP and pCO2 remained in the 90s but maintaining mentation .
# Renal insufficiency - baseline Cr unknown , may have CRI from DM .
Creatinine stayed stable from 1.3-1.5 .
Will need to renally dose all medications .
# A fib - continued BB .
Per cardiology consult recs , discontinued digoxin and started amiodarone .
Due to elevated INR , coumadin was held .
Pt is also paced .
Pt needs to be on amiodarone 400mg BID x 7 days ( loading dose ) and then 400mg daily for maintenance .
# DM - insulin standing + HISS , FS qid
# Depression - continued home regimen
# F/E/N - NPO initially while on BIPAP and now low sodium cardiac diet .
# PPx - supratherpeutic INR
# Access - PIV
# Code - DNR/DNI .
No pressors or central line per HCP .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readressed .
