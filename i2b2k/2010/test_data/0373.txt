HISTORY :
Baby Barbara Stead is a term infant admitted with increasing head circumference and bruising .
He was born to a 31-year-old G1 P0 now 1 mother with unremarkable prenatal screens as follows :
O positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive , rubella immune
PREGNANCY HISTORY :
Estimated date of delivery was 2012-05-14 for estimated gestational age of 39-1/7 weeks .
Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios with an AFI of 3.5 and by multiple evaluations for decreased fetal movement .
There was spontaneous onset of labor progressing through vacuum assisted vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia .
clear amniotic fluid , no antepartum maternal fever or fetal tachycardia , no antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis .
Baby was vigorous at delivery , was bulb suction , dried , and had free flow oxygen administered briefly .
Apgars were nine and nine .
In the Newborn Nursery , he initially had a caput which increased in the amount of swelling and bruising in the subsequent 24 hours .
He was then referred to the CMED CCU for assessment and management of the increased bleeding .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE CMED CCU :
Birth weight was 3850 grams .
Head circumference was 41 cm .
HEENT was significant for swelling of the scalp tissue in generalized distribution with ecchymosis extending from the occiput to the posterior auricular area and dorsal aspect of the neck to the mid cervical level .
Ears were displaced forward .
Eyes were normal .
Neck and mouth were normal .
No nasal flaring .
Chest :
No retractions , good breath sounds bilaterally , no crackles .
Cardiovascular :
Regular , rate , and rhythm .
Femoral pulses normal , S1 , S2 were normal .
There was a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur in the upper left sternal border without radiation .
Abdomen was soft , nontender , no organomegaly , no masses .
Bowel sounds are active and patent .
CNS active , responsive to stimulation .
Pupils are reactive to light .
Tone is normal , moving all limbs symmetrically , irritable with palpation of the scalp .
Suck , root , gag , grasp , and morrow were normal .
Skin :
Pale as above , nonicteric .
Musculoskeletal :
Normal spine , hip , clavicles , small mass at the site of previous right quadriceps intramuscular injection .
An initial head CT scan had revealed extracranial soft tissue swelling most prominently at the right frontal-parietal-occipital area extending to the left and to the upper cervical region .
Ventricles were symmetrical and not compressed .
No gross intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
But upon further radiology attending Stoughton , there was a small bilateral occipital subdural hemorrhage noted .
The initial hematocrit was 21.2 , platelets 186 .
PT was 14.6 , PTT 77 with an INR of 1.4 .
Fibrinogen was 192 .
D-dimer was negative .
ASSESSMENT :
This is a term infant with significant subgaleal hematoma with apparent extension over the past six hours .
There was also elevation of the PTT suggesting possible inborn coagulopathy .
There is also critical anemia secondary to the subgaleal hemorrhage .
He was admitted to the CMED CCU for further management .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
1. Respiratory :
Patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95% .
No apnea or bradycardia .
2. Cardiovascular :
There was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
3. FEN :
Patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized .
He has been taking breast milk or Enfamil 20 po adlib .
His admission weight was 3850 grams .
His weight on discharge was 4055 .
4. GI :
Given the significant amount of bleeding , baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy .
His bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued .
5. Hematology :
Given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed , coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated PTT level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
He was started on a 50 units / kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units / kg / day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 .
Subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units / kg and increased factor 8 infusion rate to 65 units / kg / day .
As of 05-17 , he was switched over to bolus infusion in preparation of continued home factor 8 administration .
His peak level after a bolus of 75 units / kg of factor 8 was 131 .
A trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 .
He will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage , and will be followed by Hematology visiting nurse Michael Edwards level checks at home .
Currently , the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular Broviac which was placed on 05-15 for administration of factor .
His last PTT on 05-16 was 68.3 .
The last hematocrit was on 05-16 of 54.5 .
6. Neurology :
Baby Mary Stead initially presented with significant subgaleal bleed as well as a small subdural hemorrhage .
A repeat head CT scan on 05-15 had shown the resolution of the subdural hematoma and significant improvement of the subgaleal bleed .
His head ultrasound on 05-14 reveals no interventricular hemorrhage .
He had remained neurologically stable .
His head circumference on 05-18 was 36.5 cm with a maximum head circumference on
admission of 40.5 cm .
7. Social :
Both parents are very involved in the care of Baby Norman Stead .
They have been informed up to date on his needs , discharge from the hospital .
Teaching has been completed on the care of the Boviak as well as administration of factor 8 .
8. Sensory :
Audiology :
Hearing screen was performed automated auditory brain stem responses and Baby David Stead
passed bilaterally .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Baby Julian Stead had been stable with improvement of the subgaleal bleed and good peak and trough factor 8 levels after the bolus infusion .
DISPOSITION :
Baby Corine Stead is to be discharged home with parents with close Hematology VNA followup .
