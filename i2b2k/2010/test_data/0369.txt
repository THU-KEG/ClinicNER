CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage or edema .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with normal intervals and ST wave inversions and early R wave progression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed .
1. Gastrointestinal bleed :
The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn .
As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells , the patient became tachycardic and short of breath .
His temperature raised from 98.6 F. , to 101.0 F.
He was shown to have rigors .
The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine , 100 mg of hydrocortisone , 25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid .
He had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material .
The patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask .
His saturations improved quickly on 100% non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes .
Shortly after his mental status changed ; he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours .
After that period of time , his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0 , which remained stable for the duration of his stay .
On admission , the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis .
On Wednesday , 11-25 , an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings :
Medium hiatal hernia , Barrett's esophagus , erosion of the gastroesophageal junction , granularity , erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis .
Erosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region , granularity , erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis .
It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding .
2. Cardiovascular :
During transfusion reaction episode , the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from 134 to 158 , for one to two hours .
EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia ; however , serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at 1075 , MB peaking at 114 and MB index peaking at 10.8 , consistent with myocardial damage .
The day following this episode , EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
The patient 's blood pressures remained stable during his stay .
He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry .
Cardiology consultation was obtained .
The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction .
Further Cardiologic work-up was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge .
The patient was started on Lopressor , Lipitor and Lisinopril .
3. After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions , the patient 's hematocrit remained stable at above 30 .
His INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge .
He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge .
4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying .
The need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient 's attending , Dr. Coleman , and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital , saturating well in room air .
5. Endocrine :
The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission .
His hemoglobin A1C was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge .
6. Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction .
Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol .
After this episode , the patient 's mental status remained clear for the rest of the duration of his stay .
7. Prophylaxis :
The patient was sent home on proton pump inhibitors .
His Helicobacter pylori serology was sent and was pending at the time of discharge .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home on the following medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day .
2. Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. twice a day .
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day .
4. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms p.o. q. day .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. The patient was to arrange his follow-up with his primary care physician , Bryan Smith .
2. To follow-up with his Cardiologist , Dr. Delores Padilla within one to two weeks of discharge .
