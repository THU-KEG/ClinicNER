CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71 - year-old gentleman who was admitted to the St. Anne 's Hospital as a transfer from the Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield .
Prior to admission , he had a long and complicated hospital course at the outside hospital .
His hospital course began on 2014-02-13 when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery .
His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation .
The hematoma formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit .
This emergent cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal tracheostomy .
During his subsequent hospital course , he had an additional CHF exacerbation .
He was medically managed and eventually his tracheostomy was decannulated .
However , just prior to admission to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation .
This necessitated emergent intubation .
With EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction , he was transferred to the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Diabetes type 2 treated with oral medication .
2. Cerebrovascular disease , status post left carotid endarterectomy in 2008 .
3. Status post right cerebrovascular accident in 2009 with residual left-sided weakness .
4. Status post right carotid endarterectomy on 2014-02-13 .
5. Fall from standing on 2014-01-29 with resultant displaced radial fracture which was reduced , closed , and casted .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
No history of catheterization prior to admission to the Saint Vincent Hospital .
8. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.7.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER THE Stillman Infirmary :
1. Lovenox 1 mg per kilogram subcutaneously b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Regular insulin sliding scale .
6. Captopril 6.25 mg q.i.d.
7. Lasix drip at 2 per hour .
8. Versed drip .
9. TPN .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
This is a gentleman who is intubated , comfortable , with minimal sedation .
He was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 .
His pulse was in the 70s , blood pressure 119/58 .
He was breathing 12 per minute and saturating 98% .
His CVP is ranging from 07-27 .
He was intubated and has a nasogastric tube .
His neck has a well-healed right carotid endarterectomy scar .
There is also a well-healing tracheostomy scar .
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart was regular with an S1 and S2 .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds .
The extremities were without edema .
The left arm was in a cast .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Knueppel was admitted to the CCU at the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary .
Upon admission , he was treated for his pneumonia .
He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2014-03-06 .
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery , 90% stenosis of the LAD , 80% stenosis of the circumflex , 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery .
After reviewing cardiac catheterization data , a consultation was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting .
Over the ensuing days , Mr. Nina CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia .
He was treated with a full course of Zosyn .
On 2014-03-11 , Mr. Knueppel went to the Operating Room with Dr. Streeter .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels .
He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and diagonal in a sequential fashion , saphenous vein graft to his PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM .
The procedure was performed by Dr. Streeter and assisted by Dr . .....................
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel had a long postoperative course .
His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically .
During his postoperative course , he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension .
At the time of discharge , he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction .
Mr. Knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation .
The status of Mr. Nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation .
After a very slow wean from ventilatory support , Mr. Knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine .
He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT .
For this reason , Mr. Knueppel was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close monitoring could be performed .
In addition , he had chest PT performed at very regular intervals by the ICU staff .
His pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization .
Mr. Knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital .
There is much scarring surrounding his larynx .
Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating .
As is expected , Mr. Knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his Boston Regional Medical Centerr hospital course .
The study was repeated and yet again Mr. Knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration .
After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube , Mr. Knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit .
This was performed on 2014-04-01 , postoperative day number 21 .
This procedure was performed by Dr. Kevin Taussig and assisted by Dr. Carla Solan .
The procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel Robertson a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital .
This injury had been reduced and casted at the outside institution .
Postoperatively , there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting .
His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome .
The cast was replaced by a plaster splint .
Mr. Knueppel should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon in the Worcester State Hospital for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint .
By postoperative day number 23 , Mr. Nina pulmonary status was deemed sufficiently stable .
His hypertension was well controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds .
At this point , he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft , four vessels .
2. Congestive heart failure .
3. Klebsiella pneumonia .
4. Failed swallow study status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement .
5. Central line culture positive for coagulase - negative Staphylococcus aureus , status post a 14 day treatment with vancomycin and removal of the line .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Methylphenidate 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Miconazole powder 2% , apply q.i.d. p.r.n.
6. Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Albuterol nebulizer solution one nebulizer q. four hours .
8. Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9. Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours .
10. Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four hours p.r.n. pain .
12. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
13. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
14. Tube feedings ; Mr. Knueppel is to be discharged on tube feeds , Promote , with fiber full-strength at 80 cc per hour around the clock .
His PEG tube should be flushed with 30 cc of water after every use .
ACTIVITY :
Mr. Nina activity is ad lib .
He is also to be strict n.p.o.
He should be n.p.o. until he has a repeat swallow evaluation which demonstrates his ability to swallow without aspiration .
FOLLOW-UP :
The patient will follow-up with Dr. Streeter in his office in four to six weeks .
The patient should follow-up with his primary care physician within one week .
The patient should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon at the next convenient time to determine the length of duration of his casting .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE :
Mr. Knueppel is afebrile with a temperature of 97.1 , pulse 77 , sinus rhythm .
His blood pressure was 142/68 , breathing 21 breaths per minute , 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula .
