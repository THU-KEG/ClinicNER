Chief Complaint :
Disconnected pigtail catheter
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Removal of catheter
History of Present Illness :
70 y/o F w/ tracheobronchomalacia , COPD , PMR , recurrent pneumonias who was recently discharged from Hallmark Health System to Pocasset Mental Health Center
06-07 after tracheobronchoplasty / tracheostomy and pigtail catheter placement for pleural effusions .
Since discharge pt has continued at rehab on ps vent settings but pigtail catheter fell out today so pt was referred here for monitoring .
On ROS , she notes feeling poorly , nausea , and diarrhea since d/c .
She has pleuritic chest pain which she has had since she arrested during her admission here and had CPR .
Per husband she has no cardiac history , and had a stress test ( unclr how recent ) that was normal

INTERPRETATION :
Findings :
This study was compared to the prior study of 2017-06-01 .
LEFT ATRIUM :
Normal LA size .
LEFT VENTRICLE :
Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images .
Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size .
Suboptimal technical quality , a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
No resting LVOT gradient .
RIGHT VENTRICLE :
Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion .
AORTA :
Normal aortic root diameter .
Focal calcifications in aortic root .
AORTIC VALVE :
Normal aortic valve leaflets .
No AR .
MITRAL VALVE :
Normal mitral valve leaflets .
Mild ( 1+ ) MR .
TRICUSPID VALVE :
Mild PA systolic hypertension .
PERICARDIUM :
No pericardial effusion .
GENERAL COMMENTS :
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows .
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .
Conclusions :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal .
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
Overall systolic function is good ( LVEF > 40% ).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .
No aortic regurgitation is seen .
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION :
Good global biventricular systolic function .
Mild mitral regurgitation .
The prior study of 2017-06-01 ( tape reviewed ) was of very suboptimal technical quality and not directly comparable to the current study .
If more definitive information regarding ventricualr fuynction is needed , a cardiac MRI ( ( 951 ) 247-0244 ) or radionuclide study is suggested .
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .

Oak Bluffs PHYSICIAN : Gregory,Domingo J .
Brief Hospital Course:
Pleural effusion : s/p pigtail cath drain .
Imaging indicated that the pleural effusions had resolved .
Thoracics agreed to no need for pigtail placement .
CHF :
Patient was seen by CHF ( echo results are detailed above ) .
They recommended continuing beta-blocker and titarting ace as tolerated .
Patient should be kept euvolemic once peripheral edema resolves ( may use lasix to decrease edema ).
She will need a repeat echo in 3-6 months ( since this echo showed a question of focal wall motion abnormality ).
Also , patient was started on amiodarone and digoxin was held secondary to high levels ( please restart when level less than 2 )
Diarrhea :
Stool c. diff neg x1 .
She will need two more specimens .
COPD : cont nebs .
PAF : started on amio , cont b-blocker , and patient was started on coumadin - levels ( inr ) should be monitored .
Nutrition :
Patient should be started on tube feeds at rehab
Rash :
Patient developed a diffuse erythematous rash , though to be an ID reaction to a recent fungal infection .
She has been satrted on benadryl and hydrocort for sx relief .
Please monitor this ( may need dermatology consult ).
Also a drug reaction is in the ddx but unlikely as rash started at rehab prior to receiving drugs here .
Medications on Admission :
