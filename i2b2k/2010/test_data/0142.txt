HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .

Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .
