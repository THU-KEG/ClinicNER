HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Jadiara Harrison is twin #1 born to a 17 year-old primiparous mother at 31 weeks gestation .
Mother was admitted to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital from Lawrence General Hospital Hospital on 05-01 with cervical effacement and preterm labor .
She was treated with magnesium sulfate .
She had previously been admitted here at the 24th week after a motor vehicle accident. She was treated with tocolysis and betamethasone at that time .
Due to progressing labor and presentation of twins , delivery was by Cesarean section .
Prenatal screens were notable for blood type 0 positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive .
Rubella status was not documented .
Group B strep status was unknown .
Infant emerged from the breech position .
She was vigorous .
She was given blow-by oxygen and stimulation .
Her Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes .
She was brought to the CMED CSRU for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
ON admission , physical examination reveals a non dysmorphic infant , well saturated and perfused with multiple bruises noted over the upper legs , left arm and chest .
No bony abnormalities or petechiae noted .
She was moving all joints and extremities well .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
CV :
Normal S1 and S2 without a murmur .
Lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
Genitalia normal .
Premature female .
Neuro :
Non focal and age appropriate .
Hips normal , held in the breech position .
Anus patent .
Spine intact .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , infant did not require supplemental oxygen or respiratory support .
Since that time , Jadiara has always been in room air without requiring supplemental oxygen .
She was noted to have apnea of prematurity , treated with caffeine until 2017-06-04 .
Since that time , she has had very rare spells , with none for over one week by the time of discharge .
Cardiovascular :
She was hemodynamically stable upon admission with normal blood pressures and heart rate .
On day of life 15 , she was noted to have a murmur , eventually prompting evaluation by ECHO .
The ECHO revealed an anomalous left coronary , with one end entering the right ventricular outflow tract and the other end not clearly defined .
It was unable to be delineated whether this represented an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery ( LCAPA ) or a left coronary artery fistula to the pulmonar artery .
The right coronary was prominent , and there appeared to be coronary artery collateral vessels in the posterior apical myocardium .
A small apical muscular VSD was also noted .
Several additional ECHOs were performed , including an ECHO in the cardiology department at HealthSouth Rehab Hospital of Western Mass. , but the anatomy of the left coronary artery could not be further defined .
Due to the risks of coronary ischemia if this represented an LCAPA , the infant was followed with regular ECHOs and EKGs during the remainder of hospitalization , with no evidence of ischemia , valvular regurgitation , or compromised ventricular function .
She will be continued to be followed closely by cardiology as an outpatient , with likely plans for cardiac catheterization and surgical repair when she grows to 3.5 to 4 kg .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The infant was initially maintained on IVF , with introduction of enteral feeds on day of life 2 .
She was advanced to full volume enteral feeds by day of life 7 , and then to a maximum caloric density of 28 cals / oz .
Oral feedings were introduced as tolerated .
By the time of discharge , infant is feedign BM or enfamil 24 cals / oz PO ad lib , with adequate intake and adequate weight gain .
Last nutrition labs were on 06-20 with AP of 208 , Ca 10.8 , and Phos 7.4.
Gastrointestinal :
The infant required phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia through day of life 7 , with peak bilirubin of 7 / 0.3 on day of life 3 , and last bilirubin of 4.9 / 0.3 on day of life 9 .
Hematologic / Infectious disease :
CBC and blood culture were obtained upon admission revealing a white blood cell count of 9.0 with 25 polys and 0 bands ; hematocrit was 46.9% and platelets of 222,000 .
Baby received 48 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin with negative cultures and a stable clinical course .
Infant was treated with supplemental iron , and did not receive any blood transfusions .
Last Hct was 30.6 on 06-20 with a reticulocyte count of 6.5%.
Neurologic :
Baby has been appropriate for gestational age .
Social :
Mother is 17 years old , and has been accompanied on the majority of her visits by her parents , both of whom are students .
The infant 's maternal grandparents have been very involved in her care .
Sensory :
Initial opthalmologic exam on 06-05 revealed immature retinas in zone 3 , and repeat exam on 06-26 revealed mature retinas bilaterally .
Infant passed hearing screen prior to discharge .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
To home .
PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN :
Dr. Robinson , Lawrence General Hospital Hospital
Pediatrics , 4952 Washington St. in Dr. John C. Corrigan Mental Health Center .
( 589 ) 690-3703 .
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS :
Diet :
Enfamil or breast milk 24 calories per oz , with enfamil powder .
Medications :
Ferinsol 0.2 mL po qd .
Newborn screen :
Sent as per protocol; one specimen from 2017-05-28 returned with borderline low thyroxine , but repeat was within normal limits .
Immunizations :
Hepatitis B vaccine given 06-17 .
Car seat :
Car seat safety screening passed prior to discharge .
Follow-up :
Infant will follow-up with primary pediatrician within 2 days of discharge , and will see Dr. Dale Merkel of Pediatric Cardiology in Dr. John C. Corrigan Mental Health Center on 2017-07-07 at 1:30 pm .
Due to breech presentation , a hip ultrasound can be considered in 2-4 weeks .
