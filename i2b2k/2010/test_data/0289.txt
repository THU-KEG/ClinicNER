The patient reported increasingly frequent episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath accompanied with coughing spells after walking approximately a half a mile or climbing three flights of stairs .

The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2010-06-01 , which demonstrated no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease , but critical aortic stenosis consistent with his echocardiogram study results .
The patient was subsequently scheduled for a mechanical aortic valve replacement procedure with aortic replacement on 2010-06-07 .

The patient was subsequently admitted to the cardiothoracic service under the direction of Dr. Brenda Hummer .
Postoperatively , the patient 's clinical course was largely unremarkable .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy , who declared him a suitable candidate for discharge directly to home following resolution of his medical therapy .
The patient was advanced to a full regular diet , which he tolerated without complication , and had adequate pain control provided via oral pain medications .
The patient was begun on anticoagulation therapy for a target INR of 2.5 .
On the evening of postoperative day number four , the patient had a transient episode of disorientation and confusion which subsequently resolved spontaneously .
By postoperative day number five , the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable .
His incision was noted to be clean , dry , and intact with no evidence of cellulitis or purulent drainage .
