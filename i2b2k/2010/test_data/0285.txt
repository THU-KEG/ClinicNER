Pertinent Results :
Head CT There is diffuse metastatic disease .
Three discrete lesions are seen within the left frontal , right occipital , and left parietal lobes with significant surrounding vasogenic edema .
The largest single lesion measures 3.7 x 3.4 cm .
There is moderate surrounding edema with 10 mm rightward shift of the normally midline structures with associated mass effect on the lateral ventricles .
The basilar cistern is preserved and there is no uncal herniation .
The osseous structures are unremarkable .
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated .
CT torso
1. Right middle lobe lung nodule , suspicious for metastatic disease .
2. Right upper lobe lung opacities which appear confluent , most suggestive of infectious etiology , however , cannot entirely exclude metastatic lesions .
Recommend follow up CT to ensure resolution .
3. Multiple hypodense liver lesions which are mildly enhancing , most consistent with metastatic disease .
4. Bilateral small pleural effusion , which certainly could be malignant given today 's findings and history of breast cancer .
5. No evidence of bony metastases .
6. Uterine cavity fluid of unclear etiology .
