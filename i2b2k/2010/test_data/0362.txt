LABORATORY DATA :
Complete blood count :
white blood cells 7 , hematocrit 42.7% , hemoglobin 14.3 , platelets 161 .
Differential :
69% polys , 60% lymphs , 10% monos , 5% eos .
Prothrombin time 11.7 , partial thromboplastin time 30.4 .
Urinalysis :
over 100 red blood cells per high powered field , 20-50 white blood cells per high powered field .
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 21.6 , BUN 22 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 107 , amylase 120 , calcium 8.7 , phosphorus 3.3 , magnesium 1.9 , total protein 7.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 3.6 , uric acid 5.6 , alkaline phosphatase 43 , GOT 42 , LDH 549 with hemolyzed sample .
Chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia , no congestive heart failure .
Electrocardiogram revealed Q-waves in leads II , III and AVF .
A computerized tomography scan revealed right lower occipital low-density area .
Head magnetic resonance imaging study and magnetic resonance imaging angiogram obtained on May 11 , 1995 , revealed subacute right lateral occipital lobe infarction and decreased flow related enhancement in the left posterior communicating artery with respect to that on the right .
The right suggested decreased flow .
Carotid noninvasives revealed minimal carotid disease .
Transcranial Dopplers :
normal posterior and anterior circulation .
Holter electrocardiogram :
no significant arrhythmias .
Electroencephalogram :
normal study .
Visual field testing :
small wedge-shaped visual field defect in right eye , suggesting retinal lesion .
Echocardiogram revealing segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving inferoseptal , inferior and posterior segments at the base and mid ventricular level .
Overall left ventricle systolic function moderately impaired with and estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Otherwise , there was pulmonary insufficiency , tricuspid insufficiency , mitral insufficiency and aortic insufficiency .
There were no clots seen on the echocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a right occipital cerebral infarction .
The patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives , transcranial Dopplers , Holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram .
The patient also had serial electrocardiogram , which showed no change .
The patient also had serial creatinine kinase with MB fractions studied , which revealed MB fraction too low to be tested .
The patient also experienced a feeling of moving back and forth when lying down with neck extended during the magnetic resonance imaging study and also in bed .
This moving sense , with normal electroencephalogram , was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke .
The patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed .
Our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe .
The patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80 , after the patient received his regular cardiac medications .
The patient had been off his regular medications since during the admission and will be discharged off his medications .
Otherwise , there were no further episodes of blurred vision .
The patient was stable with an unchanged neurological and physical examination and was discharged on aspirin 325 mg po qd , on May 14 , 1995 .
The patient will be randomized on the Wars study early next week by the Stroke Service at Ph University Of Medical Center .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was stable with the physical examination as described above .
DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Medications - aspirin 325 mg po qd , Glipizide 25 mg po qd .
The patient will be discharged home without his regular cardiac medications .
The patient will be followed by Dr. Ketyvi Liftjesc of the Neurology Service at Ph University Of Medical Center on May 17 , 1995 , for randomization on the Wars study .
The patient will be also followed by Dr. Joseet Gelineau of the Neurology Service at Ph University Of Medical Center .
The patient will also be followed by Dr. Margmimaui Gelineau , his primary care physician at Ochtuheihugh Put University Medical Center within one week after discharge .
The patient will also be followed by his regular Urologist at Ochtuheihugh Put University Medical Center within one week after discharge for his continuing hematuria .
