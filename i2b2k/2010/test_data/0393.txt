transfer from OSH , seizure
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Lumbar puncture
History of Present Illness :
Ms. Swanson is a 53 yo woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder , brain injury , and ? atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking .
History is obtained from her sister , William from Lawrence General Hospital , and from her primary neurologist , Dr. Brian .
She lives in an assisted living , and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90 minutes .
EMS gave her valium 5 mg pr at the facility and brought her to Barnstable County Hospital .
She persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium 10 mg and ativan 1 mg , as well as loaded with dilantin 1000 mg .
She was transferred to the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital CMED .
Here she was given an additional valium 5 mg x 2 and ativan 1 mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and right hand .
Since the ativan , her facial twitching has apparently improved , but she continues to have hand twitches .
She also had an EEG , which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read .
Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder , possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury ( though per Dr. Paula , 
records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury ) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra .
Since she has seen Dr. Ollie , she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure , as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity .
Her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control .
He tried adding lamictal , but this caused a rash .
At the time of her last visit ( 2015-03-18 ) Dr. Bradley had discussed the addition of a third Castelluccio , possibly zonegran ( less likely topamax ), to the dilantin 200 mg bid and keppra 1500 mg bid .
Her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that .
However , she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit , with 15.4 in 05 - 23.5 in Theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .
Her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in Theresa , and a review of her Union Hospital - North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .
According to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .
She has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .
The patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .
Ms. Swanson also carries a diagnosis of " atypical MS ", which she brought with her to Dr. Billie .
According to Dr. Nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .
She had an MRI in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .
She is not undergoing any treatment .
Reportedly she has been evaluated at Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children , HealthSouth Braintree Rehab Hospital , and possibly St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston .
She has not had an LP as far as Dr. Ginger knows .

CSF cytology : NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS .
Reactive lymphoid cells .
immunotyping negative .
CXR 09-28 : No evidence for pneumonia .
No change since prior study of 2015-09-24 .
CT HEAD FINDINGS : There is moderately severe , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity surrounding the frontal horns , posterior horns , and more superiorly , involving the centra semiovale .
These findings are unchanged from prior studies , and may relate to the " atypical " demyelinating process , suggested in the indication on the prior MRI ; however , they are non-specific .
There is no evidence of acute intra - or extra - axial hemorrhage .
There is no shift of normally midline structures .
The ventricles are mildly prominent , but are unchanged from the prior study .
There is no interval loss of focal gray - white matter differentiation to suggest acute infarction , though CT is not sensitive in the early stages .
No focal masses is seen .
IMPRESSION :
1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect ; no significant interval change from CT of 2015-07-20 .
2) Diffuse , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity , which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process ( as suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI ).
The markedly low - attenation ( 14-15 HU ) centered within this process suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation (" black hole "), or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis .
Generalized and marked callosal atrophy ( on the MR ) also suggest advanced , irreversible disease .
3) No mass is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study ; if clinically concerned , an MRI with gadolinium is recommended .
MRI : There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , suggesting demyelinating disease .
As previously noted , there is associated volume loss , thinning of the corpus callosum , and slight widening of the ventricles .
On post-contrast images , there is a probably stable appearance of a 5 mm linear , focal area of enhancement in the left centrum semiovale , of uncertain etiology .
Also ehancing is 3 mm linear lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly , not seen on the 08-20 MR , but that study was very motion - degraded .
The hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by multiple sclerosis .
There is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect .
No changes in the overall morphology of the brain are identified .
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .
The major vascular flow patterns are normal .
IMPRESSION :
1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter , consistent with severe demyelinating disease .
2. Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex .
This former lesion was evident on MR dating back to 2014-08-15 , though is more prominent at this time , likely due to less motion degradation of the current scan .
Etiology of these enhancing lesions is uncertain , but could be atypical manifestations of demyelination .
EEG :
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing .
Facial twitching was described by the technologist and seen on the video .
This is primarily right-sided , facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU .
There were no clear EEG correlate .
ABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side , and there were additional bursts of delta slowing  seen broadly on the left side alone .
ABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm .
They appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the right at times , though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for 
much of the recording .
It was of much lower voltage on the left .
HYPERVENTILATION : Could not be performed .
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION : Could not be performed .
SLEEP : No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen .
CARDIAC MONITOR : Showed a generally regular rhythm .
IMPRESSION : Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage dimunition , along with some slowing of the background .
The generalized and background features indicate a wide-spread encephalopathy .
The left sided slowing and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side , possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction .
There is a possibility of a structural lesion on the left , but the encephalopathy dominated the overall picture .
There were no clear epileptiform discharges .
No EEG correlate was established for the facial twitching .
The lack of EEG correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central cause ( and , indeed , this appeared most likely based on the clinical and video observations ).
Brief Hospital Course :
53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .
This is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .
In the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .
It is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .
Other possibilities include infection , including her UTI .
It is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .
Her seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .
Discussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .
Cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .
Topamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .
She was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .
She was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .
Ativan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).
MRI/MRA showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .
She will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation .
LP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).
Oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .
She will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .
Pending tests :
ANGIOTENSIN 1 CONVERTING ENZYME
EBV-PCR
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PCR
Ernest VIRUS ( JCV ) DNA PCR
LYME , TOTAL EIA WITH REFLEX TO CSF RATIO
VARICELLA DNA ( PCR )
VDRL
2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center ); no current role for MS medications .
MRI was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .
She also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the centrum semiovale .
LP was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .
Immunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).
Unfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the CSF ( lab sent CSF for other studies and there was not enough left over for OCB s).
This was relayed to the family ( Kirk ).
Given that she does have new lesions on MRI , if OCB s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS , and it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy .
This was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with Dr. Ford ( MS Hoyos ).
The family is confident in any decision Dr. Ford would make re : therapy for her MS .
3. fevers on admission : Pt w/ positive U/A , treated with bactrim x 3 days with defervescence .
4. depression : continue escitalopram ; assess need to change medication as an outpatient .
5. FEN : NGT was placed given her altered mental status , and she has been unable to pass a swallow evaluation , but has improved .
This should be repeated in several days as her mental status continues to clear .
