PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .
2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .
3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .
2 ) Hypertension .
3 ) Status post hysterectomy .
4 ) Status post appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
2 ) Lasix p.r.n.
3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .
4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5 ) Thiamine .
6 ) Lasix p.r.n.
7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
8 ) Folic acid .
9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .
10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Insulin sliding scale .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is divorced .
She has two children .
She recently retired as a clerical worker .
She denies any tobacco .
She has only social alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .
Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .
Brother has coronary artery disease .
There is no family history of hematologic problems .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient &apos;s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient &apos;s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .
After this , the patient &apos;s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient &apos;s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .
FOLLOW-UP :
1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .
3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .
4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .
6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .
7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .
8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15 , 1999 at 12:30 PM .
