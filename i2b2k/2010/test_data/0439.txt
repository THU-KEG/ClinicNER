The collection is largest at its most proximal extent , measuring 1.4 x 0.7 cm in the transverse dimension .
2. Non-specific myositis involving multiple muscle groups in the foreleg , most severe in the anterior , lateral , and posterior deep compartments .
3. Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis and peroneus brevis tendons .
No tendon tear .
4. No evidence of abnormal bone marrow signal intensity or intraosseous abscess ."
RLE Angio 03-21
" 1. Mild but multifocal atherosclerotic disease involving the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries , with no significant pressure gradient associated .
2. Significant segmental stenosis ( approx. 5-6 cm long ) in the mid right superficial femoral artery .
3. High bifurcation of the popliteal artery at the knee level .
4. In the proximal calf , severe stenosis or occlusion of the two terminal branches arising from this popliteal bifurcation ( likely the anterior tibial and the peroneal arteries ).
Two significant focal stenoses of the distal right anterior tibial artery .
Right posterior tibial artery completely occluded .
5. Patent medial and lateral plantar arteries , filled through collaterals arising mostly from the peroneal artery .
Dorsalis pedis artery not seen ."
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Morton was admitted to the TSICU .
He was placed on Penicillin G , Clindamycin , for empiric coverage of his wound , with Group A strep growth from the New England Baptist Hospital-Bryce cultures .
He was transferred to the floor on HD#2 .
He continued to undergo BID dressing changes .
Plastic surgery was asked to evaluate the patient .
Per their recommendations , silvadine was applied to the tendons to prevent dessication .
Vascular surgery was also asked to evaluate the patient 's right lower extremity blood flow .
An angiogram on HD#4 showed severe tibial disease and moderate SFA disease , no DP artery was seen .
The vascular team recommended a femoral-peroneal bypass for revascularization and performed this operation on HD#5 .
He tolerated the procedure well , please see Dr. Allgood Operative Note for detail .
On POD#1 , Mr. Morton received 2 units of pRBCs for post-op anemia ( Hct 25 ).

His wound continued to heal well and by POD #6 a VAC dressing was placed .
He received a PICC on POD#7 for his long-term antibiotic therapy .
At the time of discharge , Mr. Morton had good pain control , was tolerating a regular diet , had a well-healing wound treated with a VAC dressing , and was to continue his IV PCN G and Clindamycin .
He was discharged to a rehab facility in fair condition .
