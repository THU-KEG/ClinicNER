PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME WITH SYMPTOMATIC ANEMIA
OTHER DIAGNOSES :
2. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
3. DIABETES MELLITUS
4. HISTORY OF MULTIPLE FOCAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA
5. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE WITH DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY , EJECTION FRACTION OF 30%
6. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
7. CHRONIC BRONCHIECTASIS ON HOME O2
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical problems and known transfusion dependent secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome admitted with decreased hematocrit .
The patient has had multiple previous admissions for cardiac and pulmonary disease .
He has had chronic anemia since 1990 , but a bone marrow biopsy in 07-92 , was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome .
Over the past several months , the patient has had increasing transfusing requirements .
His transfusions have been complicated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure , secondary to ischemia cardiomyopathy .
His last admission was 9-14-93 , for a transfusion without complications , and prior to admission the patient reports having several days of increasing weakness , dizziness and fatigue .
His wife says his hands and lips have been blue .
Apparently , he had had a low hematocrit as an outpatient and was checked two weeks prior to admission but was not given transfusion because the patient did not want to come in at that time .
Aside from the above , the patient had felt that baseline without fever and chills or change in chronic cough .
He had no increase in his congestive heart failure symptoms , no chest pain , and no hemoptysis or changed in arthritis .
The patient did report taking a po antibiotic ( Ciprofloxacin ) for right great toe infection ( question of cellulitis vs. paronychia ) .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Myelodysplastic syndrome .
2. Coronary artery disease / ischemiccardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 30% .
3. History of MAT for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease / chronic bronchi ectasis , on home oxygen .
4. Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
5. Rheumatoid arthritis .
6. History of alcohol abuse .
7. History of peptic ulcer disease .
8. Cataracts , status post bilateral repair .
9. C3 radiculopathy .
10. Psoriasis .
11. History of hemoptysis , on Coumadin .
12. Status post TURP .

The patient lives with his wife and is a retired sardine packer .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature 98.8 ; heart rate 88-120 and irregular ; blood pressure 118/78 ; O2 saturation 96% on 2 liters .
HEENT :
Bilateral cataracts ; neck appeared to be somewhat asymmetric thyroid with small nodule barely palpable on the left lobe with the thyroid , otherwise negative .
No lymphadenopathy was palpated .
Lungs :
Rales 1/3 of the way upbilaterally .
Cardiovascular examination revealed jugular venous distention at 12 cm , no carotid bruits , heart rate was tachycardic and regular , normal S1 and S2 , palpable S4 , no murmur was auscultated .
Abdominal examination :
Obese , soft , non-tender , bowel sounds were present .
Rectal examination :
Heme negative .
Extremities :
Joint deformities consistent with rheumatoid arthritis , right MTP / toe with minimal erythema .
Skin examination :
Diffuse psoriasis over trunk and arms .
Neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
SMA-7 was unremarkable aside form a creatinine of 1.6 and a glucose of 207 ; otherwise , was within normal limits .
Hematocrit was 22.4 ; white count .59 ; platelets 84.
The patient had an absolute neutropenia with a ANC of 318 ; differential revealed 48 segs , 6 bands , 40 lymphs , 4 monos .
Digoxin level was 1.4 .
Theo-Dur level was 15 .
PT was 12.5 ; PTT 27.0 .
Urinalysis was within normal limits .
Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted .
EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .
There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .
There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .
In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .
The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist , Dr. Taange Peter , and Cardiologist , Dr. Peter .
