History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 78 y/o WF w/a PMH significant for HTN and afib who presented to an OSH w/ complaints of abd pain and nausea .
She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant hydronephrosis and was transferred to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for ureteral stent placement .
Her INR was found to be elevated when admitted and , in the course of waiting for this to normalize , the patient spiked a temperature to 105 and became hypotensive to the 70s .
She was bolused w/out effect and had little response to neo so she was changed to levophed , given doses of cipro / vanco / gent and transferred to the CMED CSRU for management .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24 hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since this time .
She was restarted on heparin prior to d/c as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin anticoagulation .

Pertinent Results :
CXR 2013-02-21 :
Right subclavian CV line overlies proximal SVC .
There is cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF .
No pneumothorax .
Overall appearances are essentially unchanged since the prior film of 2013-02-20 , apart from removal of the ET tube .
CT Abd 2013-02-18 :
1) Moderate to severe right hydroureteronephrosis with two obstructing distal right ureteral stones , 8 mm and 6 mm respectively .
2) Probable obstructing 5 mm right mid ureteral calculus causing mild hydroureter , though it is difficult to tell definitively if this stone is within or just medial to the right ureter on this CT without IV contrast .
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions .
4) Coronary artery calcification .
ECHO 2013-02-19 :
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated .
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal LVEF > 55% ) .
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated .
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed .
4. The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened .
There is mild aortic valve stenosis .
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is severe mitral annular calcification .
Trivial mitral regurgitation is present .
6. Moderate to severe [ 3+ ] tricuspid regurgitation is seen .
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
78 year old female with history of HTN , a.fib presenting with ureteral stone , hydronephrosis , and urosepsis .
She originally had hypotension and a leukocytosis in the ER and was admitted to the CMED CCU .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem on the day of call-out .
1. Sepsis - The patient was septic in the ER and her blood cultures eventually grew proteus .
Her Bcx remained negative throughout her stay .
She was treated with levaquin on the floor and will complete a 14d course at rehab .
She has been afebrile since she was called out to the floor .
2. Ureteral stone - The patient had a nephrostomy tube placed by IR to relieve her hydronephrosis .
She was followed by urology during her stay and will see them again 2 wk after d/c for definitive treatment of her nephrolithiasis .
At this time , urology will coordinate removal of her nephrostomy tube with IR .
Her nephrostomy tube was draining clear yellow urine at the time of d/c .
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled with beta blockers at home .
She was treated in the CMED as above .
Once on the floor , the patient had one episode of afib w/ RVR that responded immediately to IV metoprolol .
Because of this , the patient 's diltiazem was stopped and she was started on tid metoprolol .
After this , the patient had no further problems with her rate control .
She was maintained on a heparin gtt for bridge to coumadin while on the floor after this was cleared by IR and urology .
She will be d/c w/out her heparin as she is trending upwards with her INR and has no MR Paul Paquettec heart disease .
She will continue her coumadin at rehab to achieve an INR between 03-22 .
4. delirium - The patient had troubles with agitation while in the CMED CCU .
She received prn haldol w/ little effect and improved as her infection cleared .
